chefs shut up #MKR'
deconstructed tart is a biscuit and dip #Mkr'
god please don't please just stop #MKR"
@peteBREAUX_: Dessert so deconstructed, you have to go Coles, buy the ingredients and make it yourself #MKR'
wonder how many times they've used that churner #MKR"
sausages nikki and katie made look like they jumped up onto the bench and laid a turd in their bowls :/ #MKR  #MKR2015'
the sass! #MKR'
walking a catwalk involves putting one foot in front of the other...you know, like walking #MKR'

hope they bring it home with the dessert!! Go girls!! #MKR"
dumb dumb dumb #mkr #MKR2015'
@mshellsj: Deconstructed, because you can't be bothered putting it together #mkr"
curd has lemon in it Nikki? Your powers of deduction even amaze the kids on the short bus #mkr'
@nickfalkner: I dededeconstructed my tart so I just jammed a lemon in Colin's mouth. #mkr"
sorbet is looking awesome. The sorbet churner, not so much."\n#MKR'
veggie crisper will cool it down faster, ladies #MKR'

@oh_deary_me__: I just Googled 'Drasko' and this is what it came up with.  I'm feeling short changed #MKR
feel like if I were on #MKR and had botched the first two courses, I'd just serve Jell-O shots for dessert."
@mykitchenrules: Which team do you think will be eliminated tonight? #MKR
#mkr'
@AusTracey: Lazy person's menu tonight #MKR"

love sassy food haha i love humour xD #mkr'
ditch your hat!! #mkr'
the razor blades weren't near your throat\n#mkr"
going on with old mate's hat? #mkr"
@nicwkelly: Anyone who claims to be "sassy" doesn\'t really understand the concept of being sassy do they #MKR'
takes herself too seriously #mkr'
have no words. Bs meter overload. #mkr'
to see worse cooks in the kitchen than myself. #mkr'
#mkr'
#MKR'
@EloisePeace: remove the fucking hat at the table #MKR'
'let's see who can sound like a bigger knob' contest between Steve and Drasco is the only thing carrying this episode #MKR"
@AleksDevic: My dad and baba would be horrified if chevapi were served like that. That's not how you do chevapi! #mkr"
is turning into a particularly awful Come Dine With Me. #mkr'
sass one more time #mkr'
The lemon curd has lemon in it. #MKR'
@LisaMRomano: OMG this churner feels like razor blades on my hand! Oh wait... #mkr'
the talk but can't walk the walk #MKR"
curd and cream is a deconstructed lemon tart,  isn't it #mkr"
@MrTimothyKaye: Drasko/drongo\n#mkr'

have the paddle upside down in the ice cream machine! #mkr'
girls need to learn how to churn #MKR'
Idea headline: "#MKR shock! What are they hiding?".\n\nPretty sure they\'re hiding any ability to actually cook.'
knew Nikki reminded me of someone. #mkr
can we use the kitchen we have friends over  #mkr'
@conversetroye: My mamma once told me that having your hat on at a table is rude #MKR'
this for sassy? From #voguecafe @MacquarieCentre But if I hear that word again I'll throw a shoe at the tv #mkr
put the arm in the wrong way #idiot #mkr"
upside down you idiot! #mkr"
runny is fine, after all it is deconstructed. #MKR'
is to food what "shabby chic" is to decor. In other words, an excuse for a whole bunch of random shit thrown together. #MKR'
pouting is annoying me. I'm ready to wipe it off and kick her off the show! #MKR"
to Nikki breaking a yolk while separating eggs. #MKR'
I am seriously doubting that they have spent more than a few hours in a kitchen in their whole lives #mkr'
9 has just asked, "Why didn\'t they do the sorbet first to ensure that it\'s frozen in time?".  #mkr'
we stop deconstructing desserts please? Let's start a campaign, let's get some names on a clipboard, let's start a march #mkr"
@benkearns3: Ohhhhh it's hit the fan, trouble she come!  #MKR"
surprised this instant restaurant looks like the playboy mansion. Class girls class. You have none. #mkr'
it's hit the fan, trouble she come!  #MKR"
can you refine something by deconstructing it?  #mkr'
 I missed the critique on the entree, missed main now we're onto dessert #MKR"
this seems to Suggest Steve has had a fling with Nikki  &amp; they make it through #MKR'
that was a typo guys. For dessert you get SorbeNt. You\'ll need it after the spatchcock" #mkr'
wish everyone knew how much of a non gentleman that slick English guy from #MKR is. Also hate myself for watching this.'
@BerryPayneful:Lmao Katie and Nikki strutting on Coles  #MKR\n RT:@.vid.
thru deconstruction. Right. #MKR #killer blondes'
have been listening to #MKR more than watching. Heard snatch cock and thought " Yeh, they go together"'
Katie from #mkr annoy me. Hope this pops up on the screen'
lemon tart, because we're too bloody lazy and incompetent to do it properly? #MKR"
@GBO26: Ash would eat these two alive #mkr'
two might not be able to use the churning machine, but they sure churn my stomach. #mkr'
main looked like it was very bland #MKR'
#MKR2015 girls, the ice cream churner isn't broken. You just got the middle bit turned upside down."
@eastofjanuary: Does Drasko really think they cooked half birds? And he wants to be a chef? #MKR'
never used the ice cream maker before  #mkr'
no! No churner,  good luck to the girls,  they are gonna need it #MKR'
how do you fuck up an ice cream machine. it's just not possible. #MKR"
Potato/potato head #MKR'
cant get a can opener working how they going to get the ice cream maker to work. #MKR'
lips lol #mkr'
It's looking like Lynn and Tony will be safe."
is what I'd make.... My famous lemon meringue pie #MKR no deconstruction needed, it's awesome as it is.
@ZoutLiquorice: For dessert we're making deconstructed lemon tart. Because we do not know how to construct.....stuff #MKR"
team do you think will be eliminated tonight? #MKR
@SuzanneCarbone: Spatchcock-infused couscous in the microwave &amp; clothes from a Supre sale #SaidNoOneEver #MKR'

technical failure must make their stomachs churn. #MKR'
that steve on the Anzac ad? #mkr #MKR2015'
meal sounds fab #MKR'
@finicalgal: NOTE: In a spatchcock dish, the pomegranate being the "star of the dish" is not a GOOD thing.\n#MKR'
look, new idea and #mkr in a synergistic, cross promotional marketing paradigm thingy... What about a #mkr paleo range?'

gay?!?! #mkr #newidea"
can someone tell rob to take his hat off at the table, it is soo rude!'
juice in curd unusual! #MKR @mykitchenrules'

worst menu in #mkr history'
wish the #MKR #KillerBlondes would stop saying "sass"... @mykitchenrules
guess, the blondies stay, South Africans go.. #mkr'
INSTANT RESTAURANT ROUND WHY #MKR'
a rigged show, how the hell did Katie &amp; Nikki make it through? #MKR'
a Lemon Curd or was it turd.... #MKR'
looks rubbish! I would not eat there #mkr'
has been on for 9 months and we have only lost 3 teams.  #neverendingstory'
#mkr for once again letting the dramatic ones through - so boring!'

because you can't be bothered putting it together #mkr"
@PaulHaydon: You've got big hearts! Colin, I believe what you're meant to say was that they have enlarged, clogged hearts! #MKR"
do you deconstruct a lemon tart? It's custard in a tart shell. #mkr"
how many instant restaurant rounds are we gonna have? It's not like anyone will score fairly. (as if Kat will do that. GRRR)  #mkr"
is such a drag...my gosh'
really really hope one of them falls down the stairs #killerblondes #mkr'
gross that the blondes kissed the table EVERYWHERE! hygiene anyone? #MKR #MKR2015'
@brisvegas1 @QandA but how could you hold 2 jobs &amp; still catch up with #MKR every night? #urbanvalues'
yes Vicky and Celine would be in for that #MKR'
it's good to see this season of MKR is now going to go for 17 months \n\n#redemptionround #mkr #mykitchenrules #MKR2015"
@drdisco_: That "hotpot" looks like all of the Bristol Stool Chart on one plate  #MKR
get these spatch cocks out #mkr'
think I\'m watching a 4th round of  \n"bad chefs", was looking forward to next challenge #MKR'
I know right, just shoot them all get it out of the way #MKR #bored'
7 for dessert... oh Colin Colin Colin.... SIGH!'
need at least a 48 to stay in the #MKR competition. Can Katie &amp; Nikki survive elimination?
wouldn't eat anything those girls cooked tonight. But mention spatchcock to Drasko and he's all smiles! #MKR"
quality of on-screen tweets on #qanda tonight is pretty equivalent to #mkr So I\'ll go with "That policy looks undercooked!"'
the way she handled that sorbet maker was gross!! #MKR'
@Channel7 @mykitchenrules is dying a slow death.. Even @ImACelebrityAU looks a better alternative! #MKR'
time. Have a feeling that the remote may go through the TV over the next hour with these two clowns.'
@leggoet: The quality of on-screen tweets on #qanda tonight is pretty equivalent to #mkr So I\'ll go with "That policy looks undercooked!"'
many no names lined up I thought it was 'I'm a celebrity get me out of here 2'  #MKR"
food handling alone they failed because of those saliva in kissy lippies! Yuck! #MKR'
on toowoomba girls #MKR'
leaving lip prints all over the table.  Nice unsanitary way to start things....  Yuck. Why not spit on the plates too?'
should just serve up some lines and a chocolate tube wafer for dessert #mkr'
 So #MKR is going around again for another round? This series won't be ending until next year at this rate. Too much of a good thing"
Bloody Colin! Maybe he should go to spec savers #MKR'
you have to keep talking about how "hot" you are...NOT HOT. #MKR'
I saw it ... #ComeBackKitchen !?!?\n#MKR \n#RedemptionRound'
Channel 9 sticking it into Channel 7 over the contestant who plays tennis. Probably in cahoots with each other to lift ratings.'
Nikki &amp; Katie not present at their instant restaurant? Where is their confidence coming from? #mkr'
who knew that was how to do it! #MKR'
someone deconstruct Drasko please? Perhaps another serve of Croatian sausage might gag him..  #MKR'
back the more interesting teams thank god #MKR'
rigged - r u kidding they didn't even make a mediocre meal - there was no sass - they just being kept for ratings - I'm over it #mkr"
and that's just the girls! #MKR"
@DaleWoodward170: SASSY looks rubbish! I would not eat there #mkr'

can't wait to see Kat and Andre royally stuff it up in the challenges, my fingers are already starting to twitch #mkr"
I have taken from #mkr is that if all you served was a big bowl of crackling for every course you would be nailed on for victory!!'
Well, I was under the illusion that this show was about cooking. Turns out its just about who can be the biggest bitch. #mkr'
lord #mkr'
cooking skills have nothing to do with succeeding on #MKR as opposed to the drama you can provide Channel 7 to boost ratings'
last year WA had Chloe &amp; Kelly and now we have Kat &amp; Andre. Channel 7 doesn't like Perth haha! #mkr"
is a fucking joke! #mkr'
so glad all the instant restaurants are done and Colin is back! Was getting bored #mkr"
I see channel 7 have found another way to drag #MKR out for an extra few months this year'
My Kitchen Rules #MKR'
Kat do you have NO morals???? Carnt #mkr2015 #mkr'
you have to score strategically low to stay in the comp means you can't cook #mkr #feistyfoodies"
Yep, same. But it's also wrong of #Mkr to let them get away with it. #mkr2015"
@BecPobjie: I never thought I would want Katie and Nikki to do well, but here we are #MKR'
much, Kat? Andre is no catch.  #mkr'

Kat. I will cut you for being horrible. Do. Not. #MKR  #mykitchenrules'
next time Katie and Nikki cook they use everything from tins &amp; packets &amp; their dessert is a block of chocolate &amp; a tub of cream #MKR'

at least the blondes always scored fairly. They deserved to stay tonight to keep it a fair competition. Hope Kat&amp;Andre played unfair !'
#mkr'
Kat is showing her true colours #mkr'
say I would be up for this main #MKR #German'
typo I meant ONE big bowl of shit #mkr'

You're not wrong! Can't wait for their comeuppance. #MKR"
\nI'm not a fan of chicken liver.. #Entree :/\n#KatieandNikki #MKR"
eh, it really just comes down to who gets the most favourable editing on the night. They are all fairly obnoxious #mkr'
cannot decide which team I like less. #katandandre vs #katieandnikki #mkr2015 #mkr'
Kat &amp; Andre vs Katie &amp; Nikki. In the last redemption round instant restaurant who will escape elimination? #MKR
words, Pete, from someone whose Paleo Cook Book for babies was just pulled due to the possibility of under-nourished babies. #MKR'
omg I want that foooooddddd &lt;3 go girls!!'
@mykitchenrules: OMG! They have been double ding-donged! #SAsweethearts #MKR

Kitchen Rules #MKR 2015 episode 22 recap: are Kat and Andre beyond redemption? - @SMH_news
much as I was looking forward to the girls getting their comeuppance, I absolutely hate Kat &amp; Andre.. Bloody ridiculous scoring #mkr'
believe kat and andre are still there omfg don't even deserve to be there lol I can't stand them soz not soz #mkr"
For all you pissed about Kat getting through - just think of the twitter fun we are going to have at her expense next round!'
your behaviour is appalling and embarrassing soooo glad your not in my family tsk tsk #mkr'
what you will about the #PromoGirls but their apple pie does sound kick-ass. #MKR'
REALLY HOPE THESE GIRLS DO A GOOD DESERT!!! #mkr'
sauerkraut meant to be fermented cabbage? #MKR"
a spur of the moment roast lamb for 7 its offical, i should apply for #mkr'
is a dish best not served at all, Kat #MKR'
ketchup #mkr'
caught up on #MKR - I think it's safe to say Kat and Andre are the worst. I actually wanted the blondes to stay, &amp; they were no picnic!"
fact that everyone is hoping Katie and Nikki do well just shows how much Australia hates Kat and Andre #MKR'
that rely on the misfortune of others should not be given air time on Australian TV... Get a life Kat and Andre #MKR @mykitchenrules'
@greysfan: Kat and Andre have become the worst ever couple on #MKR in my eyes.'
didn't even like Katie and Nikki but oh my god kat and Andre need to leave right now. #mkr"
@mykitchenrules: Will #MKR history be made TONIGHT? Coming up next!
hope you're not #mkr"
WA R THE BIGGEST BITCHES EVER'
oh nooo!!!! Goodluck y'all!!!!"
chicken livers look massive. Did they come from foghorn leghorn? #MKR'
like liver #mkr #mkr2015"
Kat, you are a dick!'
hope Kat and Andre are eliminated next #mkr I'll make it happen"
@Itsjust55496420: Why? Why? Why? #fake #fuckmkr #rigged #mkr'
of this dish makes sense, it's bits and pieces of crap put together to make on big bowl of shit #mkr"
is definitely an A GRADE BITCH, but channel 7 will be loving it, she's a ratings puller. Everyone loves to hate her #mkr"
@BSoshi: Yes\nSheri you tell them #mkr2015 #mykitchenrules #mkr'
girls tonight have talked it up they need to deliver they better get some pork on there fork #mkr'
best way to win #mkr2015 #mkr is to cook well," said @manufeildel By far an excellent reprimand towards #Kat and #Andre'
@rinakays: Even if i didnt like their food.. id score them an 8 just because i hate kat and andre. #mkr #strategic'
and Andre need to fuck off #MKR'
I hate Kat and Andre from #MKR @mykitchenrules :/'
anyone else see that the livers were called "Mains" via the onscreen graphics #Entree #MKR'
Kat = Cunt #mkr'
 A 1? A what? That's insane... I hope it doesn't go back to them."
food, much intense, so wow, much competition #mkr'
these girls do amazing with their main course!!!!! @patrick6152 #mkr #mkr2015'
@H4mmerz: It's for toasting sandwiches not cooking potatoes for head chefs!!!! #mkr"
recall ever seeing anything so unappealing in the kitchen. The chicken livers arent doing much for me either #mkr #smug"
and Andre playing the game to WIN! Sometimes it's SO UNFAIR! #MKR #LittleBabyShopAu #LittleHoneyDe
through the #MKR tweets, rarely have I seen the C word used so often.'
@annie_chaplin I'm not opposed to the creative edit but Im finding it clumsily jarring and unsubtle in #MKR"
and why did Kat and Andre make it through?! They're seriously awful. #mkr"
luck to the people on #mkr'
@mykitchenrules: Let's hope the goat was happy! #HappyGoat #MKR
round Manu and I will not be at every challenge. I\'m fighting a negated cook book deal in court." #MKR'
chicken livers?! Yuck.. #mkr'
read Joel has left #ImACelebrityAU  :( and Kat and Andre are still in #MKR ?!? Bad outcomes tonight on reality TV tonight. Boo.'
@Louise_Fio8: Sheri &amp; Emilie are my faves! They seem like such genuine girls #mkr'
it's fair for kat and Andre to score the girls a 1 even though they deserved more? You kept most hard to watch couple in the comp #mkr"
tempted to give them a ten given their chicken liver entree might help to kill babies.\n\n #paleo"
fucking hate Mkr #mkr'
go girl! Take that, Kat #mkr'
that's MKR done for the year. Seriously, does anyone watch past the instant restaurant rounds? #MKR"
here comes the kitchen HQ crew !!!!#MKR #fourinhand #fourinhandhotel #colinfassnidge
@GidgitVonLaRue: #MKR What? The potato rosti done in the sandwich maker was a disaster???? Well blow me down with a feather!!'
behaviour by Kat and Andre. Hope the sour grapes sting on the way out #mkr #kat'
not sauerkraut lol!! #mkr"
#qldbesties Sheri I give you a 10 as eating otgans doesnt scare you.I like you to try new things and I  take you to your happy place'
love that Emma made a comment and had a dig at Kats strategic behaviour bout bloody time #mkr'
girls you got it go gueensland and stop being mean Kat and andre #mkr'
@ineedtovent: I must say - sheri is gorgeous! Lovely person - I'd be happy to know her! #mkr"
@RealtyGC: #MKR. Honestly. How can any of them attempt to cook well without at least half a bottle of shiraz in them.'
how many f&amp;$*in wankers are on #MKR\nJust when you think u get rid of two, twelve more walk in!\n#playincatchup\n#ketchupketzup\n#mrburns'
as if you can talk.. Sorry, what did you do in your first round? #mkr'
going to continue watching #MKR if it's going to be the Kat and Andre show #boring #frustrating"
1? Are you fuckin serious?! Fair suck of the sav Kat &amp; Andre #MKR'
@andrewfaith: It wasn't strategic voting Kat, it's just your food was truly awful. #mkr"
if the contestants knew the first thing about food and *then* voted poorly I'd be offended. So NOT a food show anymore. #mkr"
Kat, you are now up there with the most hated people in Australia tonight. Pure bitch #MKR'
a shows results are judged by bitchiness and not merit of the meal im not watching anymore, producers STOP the rot #mkr'
My Kitchen Rules elimination was complete bullshit. #mkr"
I really don't like those blondes but I'd like to see Kat go down slowly and painfully. #mkr"
instant restaurants lowest teams score should be not counted to balance any strategic votes and then it's out of 100 #mkr"
is a disgusting failure Vampire. What a bloody shambles, what a winner. #mkr'
@MMikhaela - some people don't deserve to be on #mkr!"
AND ANDRE ARE SO ANNOYING PLS GO HOME #MKR'
Go ladies!!! Love the sound of the crackling!!!'
Kat and Andre, you came second last #MKR'
you truly are a bitch and the lowest form of a human being. The only saving grace is that the other teams can cook #mkr'
and Andre are so awful wtf is wrong with you two? #MKR'
@kr1sh84: Well done #mkr for keeping scum on the show. Hope Kat and Andre end up poisoning all you fuckers.'
MKR lost all credibility as a competition? Permitting a teams scoring a 1 they admit freely is just to get through a little further #MKR'
never hit a woman before but Kat is really really pushing my boundaries. Ugly fucking mole #MKR"
I think this year all the action is in the kitchen...not 'the block' #MKR"
as much as i didn't like katie &amp; nikki in their first episode, i've begun to hate kat &amp; andre so much more over the last week #mkr"
even the roaches &amp; rodents would eat Kat &amp; Andre's food ! #RSPCA #crueltytoanimals #mkr"
@GracieTheEscape: Kat &amp; Andre should be disqualified as they're giving people low scores on purpose. #mkr #mkr2015"
was hoping someone would say "let\'s get Kat out, we\'ll score a 10" #mkr'
think I'd rather slightly over cooked pork chop than dishwater fish soup #mkr #FailedFoodies"
new low Kat and Andre #mkr'
to not score meals on their merits but say it's only fair you stay in the comp is a joke. Karma will come soon #cheats #mkr"
and Andre are f@&amp;$ing wankers!!! Hope they burn themselves next round! Revenge is a dish best served cold! #mkr #Reallyaone'
voting is the winner tonight not food! #MKR2015 #mkr'
@fee_bee_63: A 1? You are real arseholes. #mkr'
and Andre are absolute dickheads! #mkr'
all these people having a go at Kat like she is the only one ever to vote strategically in #MKR history. Happens every year.'
disappointed. Strategic scoring sucks #mkr'
Kat and Andre, what bloody cheats #unaustralian #mkr'
Bye Bye Blondes...\n#MKR'
&amp; Andre should be disqualified as they're giving people low scores on purpose. #mkr #mkr2015"
Kat and Andre from #mkr just leave a bad taste in your mouth. Very poor losers that's for sure."
@kevvaaa: Kat and Andre do not deserve to be in the competition #dogs #mkr'
really want to fly kick Kat in the head #MKR'
really looks like the Kat that swallowed the canary #mkr #noneedtogloat'
fought so hard in this entire comp &amp; it wouldn\'t be fair?" So, you battled it out in 2 cooks &amp; the girls are also competing? How so?#mkr'
and Andre are filthy bastards. #mkr'
#mkr ??'
Well, Kat &amp; Andre, I'd tell you 2 go F*ck yourselves but I guess you already do! Can't wait 2 see #karma head your way! #MKR"
@FourinHand: Whole flathead ......#fourinhand #fourinhandhotel #colinfassnidge #MKR
@pwafork: Rosti in a sandwich press? Christ, the office kitchen's gonna be a mess tomorrow. #mkr"
Kat, you snake. Even if you win and open your own restaurant. Who's going to go?"
&amp; Andre are a bunch of stupid gutless people. #mkr #wrong'
HATE KAT AND FUCKING ANDRE... WHAT A PAIR OF MUTTY UNSPORTSMANLIKE DOGS @mykitchenrules #mkr #evil #biggestbitch #moles #cheaters'
needs to understand that she is a terrible cook and needs to strategically vote herself out of the competition #mkr'
and Andre are scum. I am going to get such joy when you are eliminated. #mkr #katandandre'
@MickFloyd Or hit her with the so called bread she made. That'd knock her out. #mkr"
@HarryCope3: #MKR that's appauling. You give a 1 if they serve vegemite toast"
@RealtyGC: #MKR. A one? Kat and Andre. How does it feel to be the most despised people in Australia?'
god, all these people that I don't like that I'd forgotten about #goaway #10000teamsleft #MKR"
and Andre...drown yourself #MKR #mkr2015'
the fuck did Kat and Andre get thru #mkr'
+ Andre = RETARDS  #mkr'
that's appauling. You give a 1 if they serve vegemite toast"
Kat is actually Neville Wrans daughter, she's found another use for those knives...                       #mkr #mkr2015"
@R0B_17: Tonight's #mkr result proves that smug arseholes can prosper #mkr2015"
face on hearing the score. #mkr
and Andre are making me mad. Wanna kick them in the face. Every waking minute. Andre is a fuckheads name. Kat- you are a feral mole #mkr'
don't want #MKR to end!"
@FakeToniaTodman: Considering Kat has no job, she probably has heaps of time to read all our awful tweets. #mkr'
KAT IS STILL IN THE COMPETITION GET OUT GET OUT #mkr'
don't know if I'm happy or not... On one hand I really don't like the promo girls. On the other... Well, we're all thinking it... #MKR"
and Andre don't deserve it hope they destroy them in the group rounds #mkr"
strategically is logical (if coldblooded). It's a fault in the show that people can turn to it. Drama sells. #mkr #katandandre"
@_bobbidana: Never thought I'd say this but I hope the butcher girls make it through tonight.\n\nBecause kat annoys me!\n\n#MKR"
is a disgrace #mkr'
feel we're in for one hell of a ride on #MKR thanks to the inclusion of Crazy-Kat.
....Kicking my toe is better than Kat and Andre.   #mkr'
2 cheats that gave the girls a 1. Should be chucked off the show #MKR'
wished Kat and Andre would have left. Damn it, I can't stand them. #MKR"
bullshit that Kat &amp; Andre are going through. They are the most strategic, bitchy couple. #MKR'
god no... #mkr'
and Andre don\'t deserve to stay in the competition. It\'s about good cooking, not ""strategic"" voting. #mkr #outwiththecheats'
&amp; Andre the only ones in history to give a 1 and all for strategy! You don't deserve to be in the competition!!!! #mkr #losers"
a RAT #mkr'
Kat and Andre suck. Hope they get eliminated soon. #mkr'
@daybreaklover: Kat + Andre = RETARDS  #mkr'
@AdaChuu: Kat and Andre are so awful wtf is wrong with you two? #MKR'
Honestly. How can any of them attempt to cook well without at least half a bottle of shiraz in them.'
hope in the next round Kat and Andre catch on fire!!!! #MKR #kat&amp;andre'
\nWhat a low life cow Kat is  #MKR'
else is looking forward to Kat and Andre's pending elimination #mkr"
that's actually so fucked! Kat and Andre suck hair balls they should of gone, they can't cook &amp; they are fucking bitches #mkr"
Kat -_-'

shall now be known as Sourpuss #MKR #KatAndre #FailedFoodies'
Katie &amp; Nikki go, I hope one of them give Kat a left hook on the way out. What a bitch. #mkr'

I love Annie and loyld there like a real life Disney couple it's so adorable"
face at the table on hearing Kat's strategic scoring delusion. #mkr
hates you Kat!!! Shut the fuck up!!! #MKR'
hahahahaha #mkr #mkr2015 #mkrsexylloyd'
Kat says "we\'re last because everyone scored us strategically" Manu says "the way to win is cook good food" meaning your food was shit!'
not a fan of the blonde butchers, but those scores seemed awfully low #mkr"
and Andre are honestly the most annoying spiteful just irritating muppets I have ever seen They won't go home but fuck I hate them #MKR"
didn't like Katie and Nikki but i wished it was Kat and Andre that were leaving #mkr"
of disappointed the 'promo girls' have gone...they weren't very nice but Kat from WA is horrid! #MKR #MKR2015"
fav #MKR teams so far are definitely: \nEva &amp; Debra\nRose &amp; Josh \nAnnie &amp; Loyd \nRobert &amp; Lynzy\nSherie &amp; Emilie \nJaz &amp; Shaz (not in order)'
@benpobjie: I feel like a producer should step in and stop people doing this #MKR'
can't believe no one knows the difference between  sauerkraut  and  red  cabbage. Sauerkraut is pickled cabbage people!!!!!"
the contradictory cow. Says she regrets voting strategically but does it again #mkr #mkr2015'

said, Manu. #mkr'
really want that pork crackling #mkr'
and Andre you fucking conniving arseholes !! A fucking one. That's it I'm done you are simply EVIL and not worthy of this show  #MKR"
the way she flirts with the young boys at Coles........Ohhh no'
Kat and Andre are still in the comp. #MKR'
a horrible human you are to score a 1. You're not even good at cooking. Get out of here #MKR #KatAndAndre"
rekted Kat and Andre #mkr'
and Andre did not appear once in the preview of the next round of the comp. Gone early? Hope so. Yay. #mkr'
 as much as I dislike them. That dessert does look good.'
the way kat looks at Annie is like she's stearing into her soul it's just creepy"
nobody strategically scores you,  yet your bottom of the comp table Hahaha #mkr #mkr2015'
seems to be getting 'strategic' mixed up with...you can't cook and you got scored accordingly! #mkr"
fuck do you know about "fair", Kat? #MKR'
happened in #mkr, i was at indoor soccer'
Kat and Andre are a disgrace! They should be booted. To score that low to save themselves.....pffft! #mkr'
know about you but I\'m soooo over so called "strategic" voting! #MKR #sourgrapes'
Manu just put Kat in her place! #mkr'
done #mkr for keeping scum on the show. Hope Kat and Andre end up poisoning all you fuckers.'
@LynneMcGranger: #MKR ooooooh C'mon #blondebutchers ! Livers crossed!! :)"
@benpobjie: "Normally I\'d give them a three, but I feel like I\'m not quite universally hated yet." #MKR'
What a horrible human you are to score a 1. You're not even good at cooking. Get out of here #MKR #KatAndAndre"
because everyone wants to hit kat with a shovel #MKR'
A one? Kat and Andre. How does it feel to be the most despised people in Australia?'
Apple pie...bwilliant #mkr'
useless, didn't even finish that episode of #mkr might have to leave catching up for the weekend"
@BellyFlower: Kind of disappointed the 'promo girls' have gone...they weren't very nice but Kat from WA is horrid! #MKR #MKR2015"
and Andre staying is possibly the worst thing to happen on the show ever #mkr'
#absolutetwats #mkr2015 #mkr why would you be such dicks!'
watched #MKR tonight...  Kat and Andre should be disgusted with themselves...  Uncalled for on so many levels...'
want to give Kat some moisturiser #MKR'

think Annie is on sleeping medication or something. #mkr'
needs to simmer down! #mkr #calmyourfarm #nottheendoftheworld'
Awww no modelling tonight? #ThankGod'
Why does everyone say they are "voting strategically", rather than being honest and saying they are blatantly cheating. #mkr'
Kat and What's his face paid actors? Surely people can't be THAT negative all the time.  #mkr"
is such a witch! Someone throw water on her! #mkr'
Kat and Andre must be feeling so f.....d at this stage. It really doesn't matter what they say."
@benpobjie: When someone voted "strategically" on Come Dine With Me, they made her re-do her vote. Should do that here #MKR'
I want to see what cringe worthy moments Kat &amp; Andre produce out in challenges. It'll be amazing #MKR"
ugliness exudes from within hence a reflection in ones physical appearance. Lighten up girlfriend! #mkr #mkr2015'
with Petes face, looks like he's been varnished  #MKR"
thank you @manufeildel .... #Kat&amp;Andre I advise that you apply water to the burned area of your dignity #mkr
bloody arseholes Kat and Andre, to score that low is absolutely BS #MKR'
pastry looks awful!! #MKR'
kat is gonna score low for one \n1.there last \n2. She's crazy"

@deansgaljo: Crossing my fingers for the #killerblondes get rid of #katandandre #MKR'
Manu - best judge reply on #MKR that ur bad score is because of strategic voting.....do they realize they have to cook good well too?'
a collective "FUCK YOU" arises from across the country. Kat, you won\'t last 5 minutes against the other teams #mkr2015 #MKR'
#mkr gotta love my cooking shows'
is the biggest bitch I've ever had the displeasure of seeing in my life. #MKR"
a disgraceful episode of MKR, hope kat and Andre fail and that smirk is wiped off their face. #strategicbullshit #katandandresuck #mkr'
 look at Kat and Andre. They're hoping that dessert is a festering, pussie boil."
you\'ve been owned: "there\'s only one way to stay in this competition - cook good food" (Manu) #mkr #feistyfoodies'
you serious a score of 1???? Uh I hate Kat and Andre #MKR'
just go home already.'
@danranson_: I preferred the "Activated Almonds" Pete Evans rather than this new "Dangerous Baby Diet" Pete Evans. #MKR'
have you guys picked your winners for this year? Any bets? #MKR'
those carrots look overdone'
I thought #MKR was about the cooking? Why isn't anyone talking about the well cooked chicken livers?"
next season all scores get revealed at the end of each round?Then ppl like Kat &amp; Andre can't strategically score? #disgusting #mkr"
why would anyone want to eat chicken liver that's just ew no"
to make Brown Butter Ice Cream - with yoyomax12\n\n#mkr
and Andre being partially critical. We all know that insta-restaurant was worth more than 1/10 #mkr #playingthegame'
didn't like the canoodles.... #mkr #mkr2015"

@SarahVandyke3: @allankmelb Surely when you go to a restaurant you have certain expectations, given what is written on the menu? #MKR'
It's so difficult to choose between the two teams, isn't it! Despicable behaviour, much? Bah. #MKR"
calling it "being strategic" when really it is "being shameless dirtbags" #mkr'
"we cook all the time" yup they cook so much they don\'t know how to use a can opener'
Wait, I thought #MKR was about the cooking? Why isn't anyone talking about the well cooked chicken livers?"
if you were bottom of the table... Twice in one season... Answers all questions I reckon. #mkr2015'
you fucking whipped cunt!! Arghhhhh #mkr #deathtokat'
can't wait to have Robert &amp; Lynzey back!"
@bow_jvr: I would vote a 10/10 to make sure Kat and Andre go home.. You know, "strategic voting" #mkr'
awkward moment when Kat and Andre use the word "fair" in a sentence. Do you even know what that means?? #mkr'
Go Sassy Girls!!! Made that Apple Pie KICKASS!!! :D #mkr'
and Andre are seriously shit people #MKR #mkr2015'
@aps111: How does Kat justify her statement "they worked so hard" SHE CANT COOK FUCKING BREAD #mkr'
@skwashd: @dan_cake or you could just stop watching crap like #mkr.'
aahhh that pork looks ssoooo good.'
and Andre are behaving in such a spiteful, vindictive manner. Who do they think they are - #MKR contestants?'
would try the main course, but I would never touch the liver from the entree #MKR'

@LynneMcGranger Not happy wanted the girls to win.#mkr'
one more time to see if Kat and Andre had managed to stop being awful people. No. Not even after Manu warned them. Bye bye #mkr'
world would be a better place if Kat and Andre left the show #MKR'
seems more like a dog with all this strategic voting #MKR'
Surely when you go to a restaurant you have certain expectations, given what is written on the menu? #MKR'

pork cutlet and crackling looks so yummy, not sure about the other stuff on the plate ;) #MKR'

you want to win, you win by cooking good food not by sabotaging other people, that's not a win that's cheating, Kat &amp; Andre suck #MKR"
strategic; just being an A*hole. Calling it something else doesn't make it ok. #mkr"
@sales88194029: At least Katie &amp; Vikki can cook Garlic ! Bonus  #mkr'
are complaining that it's taking too long. typical of andre and kat #mkr"
believe those two fucktards are still in the competition. MY MIDDLE FINGER SAYS HELLO TO YOU KAT &amp; ANDRE #assholes #mkr'
Kat &amp; Andre. Congratulations. You've just won a one way trip to mars."
didn't like the blondes, but i wanted Kat and Andre gone a hell of a lot more, i despise them so much, they are disgusting people #MKR"
in #cyclone areas in #Qld ? #MKR fans\nConcerned re #pets, NOT in evac centres ? \nEmail #JoanneMillerMP  police@ministerial.qld.gov.au'
think only judges scores until the end when contestants just rank the other 4 teams. 4 for best, 3 for 2nd etc Can't cheat then #mkr"
and Andre are like, the worst. They probably don't have friends. #mkr"
have a few favourites #mkr'
@EmilyyLam: With 14 teams on our screen, it means ONE GOOD THING. LESS KAT!!! And more people I like. #MKR #MKR2015'
we said in my country: Fish dies for the mouth. See ya girls. #mkr'
decide if I dislike the 'promo' girls more than I dislike Kat &amp; Andre. Either way one of them is gone tonight. WINNING! #mkr2015 #MKR"
@colonelkickhead: "But you all respect him"....Pete hasn\'t read twitter has he #MKR'
@Sonia3044: Good news is Kat and Andre aren't shown in the promo ads...  #mkr"
Katie.. trusting your instincts is like trusting the instincts of  the Titanic Captain.'
&amp; Vikki have requested a Breville Sandwich maker to be added to the kitchen at MKR head quarters #technicallychallenged #mkr'
Katie&amp;Nikki make it just 2take out Kat&amp;Andre #MKR'
@blooodygorgeous: Kat missed the op to redeem herself in the kitchen but also in the character stakes #mkr #shameshameshame'
what was that? You can't burn anything on a toastie? #mkr"
@Kirstin_McM: I think the whole country hates #Kat right now #mkr'
there are more people left in this competition than probably live in Mount Isa'
my hearties we get to see Captain Salty farm more salt Thursday and her trusty gimp I mean first mate do nothing at all #mkr'
scoring is ridiculous. "Liked 80% of it so only giving a 4" #snakes'
Jane was safe with the score of 92. Did they forget or I missed the announcement ? #mkr'
wonder if not having a doorbell disqualifies you from applying to be an #MKR contestant.'
To stop this strategic voting, perhaps announce all the scoring for each group of instant restaurants when they go to kitchen central.'
My crap tastes better than the shit Kat &amp; Andre served up. I wouldn't feed it to a dead cat. #villans #cheats #mkr #mkr2015"
#MKR prediction: Next season there will again be 2 judges, but they will be Manu and Colin.'
can barely tolerate Kat and Andre, Katie and Nikki are annoying but I'd rather see them than Kat and Andre #mkr"
wish Annie would stand up and punch Kat in the face. #mkr'
voting in a cooking competition will only get you so far, when you are an oxygen thief that cannot cook. #mkr'
Kat I don't like anything on tonight's menu, well go back to Hungry Jacks then or eat the shit u served up the other night"
gives me the absolute shits #mkr'
@hazpopbeepbeep: Cannot wait for kat and andre to crash and burn in the challenges... #MKR'
want Sheri &amp; Emilie to have their own show. With special appearances from Annie &amp; Lloyd. #MKR'
@bdv1968: I'll say it if no one else will......that Kat needs serious medication #MKR #MKR2015"
for toasting sandwiches not cooking potatoes for head chefs!!!! #mkr"
editing might be to blame but srsly #katandandre need to check themselves! Can't wait till they're out cooked by the other teams #MKR"
seems to be 2 ways to succeed in #mkr cook terribly, whinge excessively about not getting a fair go and give 1's or u know, cook well"
why are all tonight's contestants dressed like they are going on dancing with the Stars?"
&amp; Emilie are the cutest whilst Kat &amp; Andre are the most vile. #mkr'
No sauce for your Pork, Lloyd will be so upset, he loves a sauce with his pork'
#mkr result proves that smug arseholes can prosper #mkr2015"
@kenzie_mariah: KAT IS A FUCKING CUNT #mkr'
aaannndd Thats why i love you  @manufeildel #mkr'
times on #MKR - just 67 teams left'
you had an ounce of self respect, you'd accept that you have room to improve. Kat and Andre, you're so disappointing. \n#MKR"
absolutely delusional if she thinks it was "strategic scoring" that put them on the bottom of the leaderboard!! #MKR @MyVancouver'
get home to watch #mkr'
and Andre are horrible people who do not deserve to still be in this competition #mkr'
face..the only thing worse than her cooking #MKR"
thought you had the trolley mate!" "I\'m crossing off the list mate!" Hahaha gotta love Jac and Shaz! #mkr'
here are the tears. Get over it, you didn't do a good job. Stop blaming strategic voting. #mkr"
been sucked into the trap once again thinking this show *isn't* rigged when it obviously is #mkr"
a lighter note... Yay! No more instant restaurants!!! #MKR'
meals for #jetstar? Good thing most of them can't cook for shit, wouldn't want to make the airlines food good for once #MKR"
totally amazing how people make an ass of themselves on #MKR"
@norme73: #mkr i noticed Kat and Andre weren't in any of those upcoming clips. hehehehehee"
@karina__hogan: @wedancedonce #mkr purposely pick slightly unattractive girls who're besotted with themselves. Makes good television lol"
up land wubbers oh how Capt. Salty smokes small cuts of fish for five minutes in her new cook book Shit cooking ahead #mkr'
Actually wanted to throw my remote at my tv after that score!! Shitty strategic score you witch!! #Cheats #UnfairScore\n\n#MKR'
find it fascinating that one bad critique after the other, Katie &amp; Nikki still think their sh*t don't stink. #mkr"
wait for the VIC girls, Ash &amp; Camilla to wreck Kat's ass . Like girrrrl, learn manners and etiquette #mkr"
@KelAnne_: I like how Kat and Andre are the ones trending.. #MKR'
The bimbos make an awesomely awesome kick ass awesome apple awesome pie. Which has to be perfectly awesome or they'll go home. Awesome!"
comeback Manu. Cook some good food next time Kat and Andre #mkr'
don't like wishing ppl bad luck but gosh I really dislike Kat and Andre. Much worse than tennis man! #mkr"
looks promising. Pls say their absence means the #FauxFoodies R the 1st couple eliminated in the next round! UGH. #CantStandThem #mkr'
for most disgusting person on tv - Kat - so much joy in winning by playing unfairly #mkr'
pathetic Channel 7 #mkr'
love how excited Kat! I mean she can\'t cook and their turning up the heat! As she actually has to cook "quality food" #MKR'
@idesequera: #MKR There can only be one #grug so stop trying Kat.
Yummy the judges make it stressful  @mykitchenrules #mkr'
@Channel7 lose this Pete Evans clown. He is dangerous. #MKR \n
I hope Eva and Debra win the competition #MKR'
to watch my last episode of #mkr  fucken over it'
hate Kat and Andre. #mkr'
you always make my cry #mkr? Why?'
worries Pete and Manu, take all the time off you need. In fact, feel free to fuck right off - I prefer Colin #mkr'
Well too say I'm pissed off at that result would be an understatement. But I'm confident we won't have Kandre for long. Can't cook."
the Rat\n\n#MKR'
officially hate Kat and Andre!! That's more like cheating than being strategic! Really heartless animals they are. #mkr"
to be eliminated needs to be Kat &amp; Andre for sure!! #MKR #theyneedtogo #cannotwait'
I just basically started #MKR. Why are they serving chicken livers? Vomit!'
we didn't see Kat and Andre in any of those cut aways?  #mkr"
couples remain on #mkr. Means if one team is booted out every week and two in semi finals then show will finish mid May.'
truth behind another elimination round...to get rid of #cuntandandre #mkr'
enjoy #mkr for the cooking not to watch feral human behaviour; Kats gotta go'
What\'s with all the "It\'s not what we were expecting." Judge what\'s put in front of you, not what you think should have been supplied.'
the freakin hell do Katie &amp; Vikki puree everything ? #mkr'
believe I have to watch more of these two flogs, Kat and Andre on #MKR"
hope everything goes well for the girls #mkr #mykitchenrules'
this is both season 2015 and 2016. Next they\'ll advertise it as "continuing after the tennis." #MKR'
to say that the real compitition has begun Katie and Andre, but do you have the gumption? #MKR'
like we are in for an emotional rollercoaster. Going to be great!!! #MKR'
can eliminate teams by strategically voting, but what sort of person does that make you? A chef, or a petty person? #MKR'
really low.  #MKR"
- get this off my FB page asap!\n\n#paleo #mkr
and Andre are such revolting human beings! #MKR'
#MKR #KatTheRat'
wrote this script?  #mkr'
the other hand, you can argue that if strategic scoring wasn't invoked - Katie &amp; Nikki still fell short with their menu to stay #MKR"
holy crap are you fucking kidding me?  ANOTHER elimination round???  It's not going to end is it?  EVER"
only problem is there are worst cooks then captain Salty #mkr'
@PollyMaeve: Fucking Kat and Andre. Eew. #MKR'
don't all the contestants just score each other 1? That evens the field. #mkr"
clearly aren't even trying to hide how rigged it is anymore.The girls should have stayed but Kat's more controversial.#mkr"
is closed! Hooray for the end of instant restaurants and time to head to Kitchen HQ for challenges! We asked for change and got it!'
@Robertkirby538: Kat and Andre fuck up you're both oxygen thiefs #mkr @mykitchenrules"
Kat &amp; Andre seem to have some very strong feelings against strategic scoring....until they decide to engage.  Two horrible people!'
old two wheel @FourinHand Colin\n#mkr'
Colin is back! #MKR'
are all these people? I've forgotten #mkr"
@LynneMcGranger: OH NO!!!!! ( she says sticking needles in her eyes!!)#mkr'

@Catatwitering: Hope they get booted next round #kandre #MKR'
@spanner77 just not the new breed of #mkr'
Kat and Andre get to stay? Seriously? This is so unfair. So not impressed with the strategic scoring. Karma WILL be a b*tch'
If I had immunity, I'd cook poo sausage."
how many teams are we 'starting' with now? #mkr"
you Kat &amp; Andre! Hope karma comes around and bites you in the arse!!! #mkr'
someone get that homeless Irish guy a jacket that fits? #mkr'
Foghorn, The English Geezers, the blandos &amp; the dead beat Dad gets immunity. Brilliant. #MKR'
another judge you have to please. He has compromising photos of the executive producers" #MKR'
favourite teams pushed to the limit. So Kat and Andre will have to cook weetbix and milk then. #mkr'
the actual fuck???? Are they saying there are no more instant restaurant rounds??? I feel ripped off there were only 23 rounds... #MKR'
more instant restaurants? #MKR'
wait for kat and andre to crash and burn in the challenges... #MKR'
is the deadbeat Dad/tennis coach/friend of the judges still in this show??? #mkr'
hope their cooking shows through the next round. I mean, they have to plate it up right? All their (lacking) skills. #MKR'
i noticed Kat and Andre weren't in any of those upcoming clips. hehehehehee"
#ashandcamilla are back,  #mkr'

of that is on tomorrow? ... Wow, it's going to be a long episode! \n\n#mkr"
kat and andre didn't vote fairly they don't deserve to win."
to saddle up... #MKR'
of now, favorite teams on #MKR would have to be Eva &amp; Debra and Will &amp; Steve. least favorite would definitely be Kat and Andre'
really? No more instant restaurants? THAT'S SHOCKING. #MKR #MKR2015"
@Oh_tobs: Bless I totally forgot about the party favourite Shaz... #MKR'

really hope Kat and Andre fail in the most spectacularly and humiliating manner possible. Thoroughly horrible people. #mkr'
and Andre can fuck right off. #MKR'
@sharonpiggott: Don't understand how bad sportsmanship can be condoned by #mkr #strategicscoring"
disgusted with Kat and Andre's scoring - really disappointing #mkr"
and the unhygienic greaseball returns #mkr'
glad Will and Steve are back, though. #MKR #MKR2015"
and Andre must be pretty fucking shit cooks if you need to vote a team 1! #mkr2015 #mkr'
not watching this show now that Kat and Andre are through. Pathetic people with no dignity whatsoever @mykitchenrules'
Kat &amp; Andre are the real losers'

Women\'s Weekly reports Pete Evans\' book recalled over "dangerous" paleo recipe for babies  #mkr'
SHOW IS SO UNFAIR #mkr'
did they even have chickens back in caveman times Pete?'
This is why this show is ridiculous - it's not about the cooking...it's about the game playing. #mkr #whogivesa1"
is back....#MKR'
who I am: WE HATE STRATEGIC SCORING BUT WE GIVE THEM A 1 #mkr'
there was a home viewer vote. Kat and Andre would be loooooooooong gone #mkr'
#mkr had any integrity they would disqualify Kat and Andre for strategic scoring #MKR'
all respect him...you respect him, right? right? #mkr'
gave me feelings as he walked out then. Not sure if good or bad... #MKR'
Robert is back! #MKR'
ahhh... the dulcet tones of Robert the Texan...'
favourites are back'? Uhh.... what?! #MKR"
so the results, why would the other teams not up the score to drop kick Captain Salty and her first mate beta? #mkr'
judges are about to turn the heat up in the competition! What do you think is in store for our remaining teams? #mkr'
is a very valid case to be made that strategic scoring by multiple teams impacted the elimination tonight #MKR'
that's a big double announcement for #mkr! What does everyone think?"
feel the need to throw something at the tv. Kat doesn't deserve to go through. #MKR #bitch"
Jac and Shaz and Robert and Lynzey! My faves! #MKR'
I officially dislike Kat the most #mkr'

IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE! \n\n#mkr'
#mkr'
you need to fix your voting system so it can't be rigged like this"
#mkr'
I love that tie!! #MKR'
I'm so annoyed Kat and Andre are still there! #MKR"
judges are scoring strategically to get Kat out of their sight #MKR'
with spinich - who doesn't love spinich! #mkr"
kick ass part of the dessert was the ass cream. Kudos Manu! #MKR'
I can't bare Kat and Andre #mkr"
girls are through  #mkr'
disgusting result scoring them a 1 #mkr'
@MKR_Official a 17? I smell a fine cotten scandal #mkr2015 #MKR'
please tell me that Kat &amp; Andre get sent home tonight #mkr'
never eaten chicken liver. #mkr"
and Nikki pissed me off at the start but Kat and Andre are the worst team on mkr #mkr'
NOOOOO!!! I wanted Kat and Andre to lose!!!'
will have to switch off if kat and andre make it through #mkr. I won't be able to handle the tsunami of smugness."
didn't really love Katie and Nikki to begin with but I really preferred them over Kat and Andre and how shitty they are #mkr"
only both those bottom teams could be eliminated #mkr'
was the 2 points kat took off to be strategic... #mkr'
#mkr whyyyyy'
an 8 from Pete is definitely strategic. Strategic to increase TV ratings. #MKR'
I don't know how many more episodes with Kat and Andre I could stand. #mkr"
like Kat got the cream after all #mkr @mykitchenrules'
@avenueminga: Pete Evans "make your own baby formula" may be fatal for babies #MKR
No No No No No No'
everyone is scoring strategically! Get rid of the ones that can cook and keep in Kat &amp; Andre, that can't cook."
if i didnt like their food.. id score them an 8 just because i hate kat and andre. #mkr #strategic'
cry foul! Boooooooo!!!!!!! #mkr'
am furious. #MKR'
unfair and fucked up #mkr"
no no no it's a conspiracy.  #MKR"
annoying. Kat &amp; Andre go home #MKR'
Kat and Andre they are next to go!!  #MKR'

shit #mkr #mkr2015'
RIGGED. RIGGED. #MKR'
quite sorry for the NSW promo bitches! #mkr'
wrong they don't deserve to be eliminated. They did a lot better than Kat and Andre. It's disgusting  #mkr"
off! Poor girls, that's ridiculous! #mkr"
is good at maths? What do they need to be safe? #MKR'
#mkr'
they just send Kat and Andre home anyway because they're rude and annoying and score everyone strategically  #MKR"
Ladies. Manu is not excited about the prospect of your entree. He's excited about the prospect of you going home."
need a couple of 8's? #MKR"
 #MKR'
and Andre are the sort of people who would look forward to funerals knowing they will be getting a free feed afterwards. #MKR'
NO!!!!! ( she says sticking needles in her eyes!!)#mkr'
and Andre are now more hated than Adam and Carol. #mkr'
I hear the guests gave 17? If so that's quite a joke. #mkr"
think Manu has a soss addiction, someone needs to hold an intervention #MKR'
for Twitter to go in meltdown #mkr'
well. They have no chance of winning anyway. Good luck you idiots #mkr'
@TheAngelaOfOz: "It wouldn\'t be fair." Cause voting strategically is fair, right Kat? #mkr'
but even if you did make it through there was no way you would have made it to the end. #MKR'
#MKR'
and Andre are the worst #MKR'
not close at all #mkr'
and Andre celebrating bad cooking, bad attitude and strategic scoring. Absolute champs. #hell #MKR'
tonight proves nothing else, instant restaurants should be judges scoring only #mkr Pathetic from Kat and Andre.'
Kat &amp; Andre survive!!!! #mkr'

I'm done. That mole got through, outrageous #mkr"

Kat's look of shock!!!! what a fake load of shit. hope she's a goner as soon as they get back into the main round. Won no fans here."

Kat.  Because nobody else worked hard in the competition.   #FFS  #mkr'

always needs an evil team for ratings. Kat &amp; Andrew are that evil team. They will intentionally survive.'
quality food &amp; they have frozen beef cheeks?! #mkr'
hope #katandandre don't get kicked off\n#SaidNoOneEver #mkr"
should be classed as cheating. Everyone scored Kat and Andre fairly and accordingly. Why can\'t they do the same? #mkr'
I went with a different thought altogether but it didn't fit so I had to simplify. :) #MKR #MKR2015"
@lliam_BL2: #MKR and #GoggleboxAU Can both go FUCK them selves!!!'

YES GURL #mkr #ashandcamilla #socialites #vicrepresent'

#MKR was not first audition for Kat and Andre!

seriously think that "to perfection" has become my absolute least favourite phrase ever uttered in the history of humanity. #mkr'
and Celine kickass I hope they do  #mkr'
that lineup looks like a prison parole parade'
straight into Sudden Death! #mkr'
might have to eat her words after receiving some not so great feedback on their ham and gruyere dish. #MKR #tvweekmag'
ha the look on Kats face when the judges delivered their critique #priceless #mkr @mykitchenrules'
circle that Kat and Andre will face sudden death #mkr'
I'm loving Colin apart of the judging this year !!! He is awesome @MKR_Official"
@CorinnaSladey: Soggy ham n cheese sanga VS shitty meatballs , cmon give us a cook off with these front bums @mykitchenrules #mkr'

suckeeeeers! Karma's a bitch Kat &amp; Andre!!! #MKR #hungrycampers @mykitchenrules"
Colin is whinging about TOO MUCH PANCAKES?! Well, I hate unicorns.\nSee, now we're both complaining about things that don't exist."

@maddotsu: And Kat thought her bake was great. So delusional  #mkr'

number of gozleme in one statement. #mkr'
@davidlw80: #mkr officially lost any respect for Collin that I had left!'

@Kirrily: Is Kat crazy? Like The Joker. Cruel &amp; crazy. &amp; clueless #Mkr'
god Annie and Lloyd what the hell? #mkr'
&amp; Emilie are @CarlyandTresne 2.0 #MKR'
so happy for Sheri and Emilie #mkr"
Kat repeat the same unbridled joy she had for Annie failing towards her own failures? #MKR'
sucked in Kat &amp; Andre #cantcook #boringfood #MKR'

@NewIdeamagazine: Good advice, kid! To Emilie &amp; Sheri: "You need to wake up earlier" ... Too cute! #mkr #mkdons @mykitchenrules'
What the hell were Annie and Lloyd thinking??  #BadChoiceSA #MKR" Kat might get their wish of going up against her...'
"Sudden death is actually literal. The teams will have to live on the paleo diet and see who dies first." #MKR'
do you understand the meaning of karma #EducationIsNotACrime #mkr'
My. God. Seriously, pure evil. That is not editing, it's just plain nasty to make those comments. #MKR #KatandAndre"
we LOVE the idea of a #campingchallenge #GreatAussieBBQ  #katandandre are going down #MKR'
it's a Kat and Annie showdown, the 'sudden death' could be literal. #mkr"
attitude is getting on my nerves. @mykitchenrules #mkr #mkr2015"
on #MKR says what every one else is thinking #smugfaces.'
job is to stand there and do nothing hereby scaring all the Bears away #mkr'
from my other half about Kat 'You can tell she's a rough pub mole'. #mkr"
@jlgimenez85: #mkr Annie- go ahead, punch her in the ovaries!'
and Andre's reaction to Annie and Lloyd was disgusting. They so deserve to be eliminated with extreme prejudice #MKR #MKR2015"
there an eviction tonight? If there's any justice in the world, it will be Kat and Andre who get booted. #MKR"
in shock.  And humiliated.\nSo enjoyable.\n#mkr'
actually cooked logically for camping Josh/mum whose name I can't remember #MKR"
@LisaMRomano: The ever charming Kat has a moment of humour #MKR'
the kind of person that would cheat to win and then still think that made her a better cook. So my new baddie #MKR'
delish burritos with my boy :) #instafood #burrito #mkr
@mykitchenrules: Favourite (and cutest) review so far! Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! #mkr #hungrycampers'
Capt salty is smoking something #mkr'

think I have ever seen a nastier piece of work than Kat and Andre. #mkr #oxygenthieves"
Camilla and Ash. Well done girls. You did amazing. #MKR'
&amp; mum have the right combination. Adding extra bacon after a request, is the perfect touch. Well done. People like free add-ons. #mkr'
Great critique for Sheri and Emilie!!! Go girls!!! #MKR'
now I just hope Kat and Andre crash and burn - nasty little biscuits #mkr'

Based on the crap served there should be FOUR teams in the cook off!'
#adbreak photo of grandson
&amp; Andre got a right slap there, just wish it was literal! Vile individuals taking great satisfaction in the negative of others. #MKR'
Kat and Andre did was cut up bread and layer it with ham and cheese and they can't even get that right seriously they need to go #mkr"
@Nodonn3: #MKR because 5+ minute add breaks are just the best!'

&amp; ANDRE CANNOT COOK NOT EVEN WITH CHEESE &amp; HAM PLEASE ACCEPT THIS OBVIOUS TRUTH #MKR'
MKR producers for the brilliant side by side editing there. Served up some sweet humble pie to Kat &amp; Andre. #MKR'

kat's smile gone in less than 5 seconds #mkr"
Kat, Kat - who are you going to blame now? And without 'strategic' voting, your days are numbered! #MKR #seeyalater"
review of Kat &amp; Andre is equivalent of a teacher saying well done on writing your name in pencil. #mkr"
@Lovemycoffeetoo: Where's Manu? Did I miss something at the beginning of the show? #mkr"
dish sounds DELISH!! #MKR'
that Kat &amp; Andre, scum of the earth LOL #mkr. I just can't with them...\n#mykitchenrules."

how many times does karma have to slap you in the face till you realise you can't cook, Kat and Andre?"
and Andre are so so mean. #mkr'
poor #mkr contestants having to camp &amp; cook for 200 for breakfast. Camping! Putting up a tent! Not staying in a cabin. Camping! Yuck!'

Sherri &amp; Em go to Sudden Death, they'll nail it: bounce back! #MKR"
in good form tonight #MKR"
and Josh are one of my favourite teams on #mkr'
vs Annie in sudden death!  PLEASE #mkr'
when Kat &amp; Andre go to campgrounds, it's so they can enjoy some dogging #MKR"
challenge is really separating the good cooks from the bad #MKR'
balls and that's not\nIncluding the food Annie and Flloyd have butchered  #mkr
yes, they were one of the top teams and were safe #mkr'
when can you get a car anywhere near The Basin? #MKR'

@adamlambert woooo hooooo \\o/ just so awesome of #mkr to play it!!!! :)'
lot of people would like to put Kat to sudden death #mkr'
rather have gozleme for breakfast instead of a plate of sugary pancakes #mkr"
Annie &amp; Lloyd and Celine &amp; Vicky representing SA, can you all now understand why we are the serial killer capital of the world? #mkr'
do they like lamb and leftovers in Disneyland?  #mkr'
the hell are Debra &amp; Eva?! what did you do with them?@mykitchenrules I want answers!!! #MKR'
are the food police? Colin needs to call 000 #mkr
didn't any of the teams serve up cold pizza as a breakfast item? #mkr"
#MKR How the fuck do you fuck up breakfast???" Not surprising for people who mess up a dish they\'ve cooked a million times'
not breakfasting the Paleo diet Pete but it's right up there with Pizza in my breakfast book! #MKR"
Annie/Lloyd vs Kat/Andre elimination cook off would be....oh God....please let this happen.  #mkr'
@j_e_p: How good would sudden death be with Annie &amp; Lloyd vs Kat &amp; Andre. #mkr'
@GlobeAlone: Annie's reaction when Lloyd said Disney Land is why I hate her #mkr

rissoles for breaky. It's a crime against cooking! #mkr"

a crime against cooking' the shade #mkr"
feel like making pancakes #MKR'
love little kid 'foodies'.  #mkr"
hey Pete, maybe what those kids need is some liver milk!
watching the screen and briefly thought Colin was Manu doing a bad Aussie accent #MKR #wtf"
sure opening the bbq to let all the hot air out will make it cook faster. #mkr"
sorry Vicki and Celine but ur baked eggs and tomato dish looks more like an abortion'
wonder Pete is always in a bad mood. It must be hard to eat bad food all the time. #MKR'
(and cutest) review so far! Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! #mkr #hungrycampers'
is back. Show us ya norks! #mkr'
How do you screw up cooking bread... in a cooking competition #mkr'

@TVWEEKmag: Are the hungry campers looking like happy campers? We're feeling the stress on #MKR tonight. #tvweekmag #BBQbreakfast"
reckon Rob And Dave could serve shit on a stick and those scabs, I mean campers would eat anything #mkr #freeloaders #fcknYobs'
8 out of 10. Unless you\'re Kat and Andre. Then it\'s a solid and strategic 2 out of 10."\n\n#MKR'
really want hotcakes and pancakes so bad! #MKR'
beans tin on the Weber and jaffles in the fire. Should've gone on #mkr"
- "You have to wake up earlier" LOL #MKR'
not even the fact that its 1D cause they always play 1D. It's because it was ready to run and that isn't even a single! :D #MKR"
Go Rob and Dave, do it for the Boys!! #mkr'
would think after the last so many seasons Of #MKR they would learn to cook something easy, but yummy'
you're cooking for the public, a safe option is a good option. You want more people eating/voting! #mkr"
looks delish love Jane and Emma's hotcake dish it looks to good to eat through the television"
that Nandos advert really just happen? #MKR'
happy to hear #mkr playing ready to run by @onedirection made my day! #hungrycampers'
a whole lot of gozleme pain for Sherri &amp; Em #MKR'
Kat: "Everyone loves it" cut to: "I didn\'t like it" #denial'
&amp; #AshandCamilla are the strongest contenders so far. Will the campers agree with the judges? #MKR #tvweekmag'
They're 'immune' for being top scorers in their round - I think 4 teams are, so not cooking this time. #mkr"
yes, bacon for breakfast, what a terrible idea'
a cave nearby where Colin keeps his stuff #mkr"
on scores Annie &amp; Lloyd vs Sheri &amp; Emile\nBased on personalities, Kat &amp; Andre vs.....fuck it you're out\n#mkr"

never liked maple syrup with bacon. It ruins two great ingredients.\n\n#MKR"
ask campers to wait for breakfast. Gotta give them what they want and now! #mkr"

Bowl of cornflakes or wheat bixs would be perfect @mykitchenrules: Here come the #hungrycampers! #mkr'

@ChristineLockw2: Mmmmm, maple Bacon How can you go wrong !!!! #MKR'
flicked onto #mkr. Someone is claiming they are serving up food that they cooked. What did I miss? #justasking'
that the point Pete? Appeal to the public? #MKR"
it took her ages to learn after she escaped from roswell #mkr'
believe they haven't put out one gozleme. Epic fail. #mkr #sad"
looks like there are quite a few Asian campers there.  Someone should have made congee.  #mkr'

back in the English Boyz tent. #mkr
Adam isn't involved in this challenge, he'd hate the thought of feeding children #mkr"
are Kat and Andre even serving? Doesn't look/sound appealing at all :/ #mkr"
with manu, if camping was involved I wouldn't show up either #MKR"
would eat Annie &amp; Lloyds food! I eat steak for breakfast!! Mmm #annie&amp;Lloyd #mkr #mkr2015'
in our element serving food we\'ve cooked.Which turned out a whole lot better than Plan A: serving food someone else had cooked."\n#MKR'
always ruins shows like #MKR and #ImACelebrityAU because I'm behind time :( #feelingsad
rolls of some sort with coffee. #strayan #mkr'

 Bloody ads - I read about 300 tweets in the ad break !'

just realised that Annie reminds me of one of the replicants in Bladerunner... #mkr"
No, that kid is just a brat #mkr'
few teams have been caught out by the time and volume requirements. I would aim for 30 servings and something tasty with cheese. #mkr'

marge, I'm missing the chili cook off! #MKR
please let Kat/Andre go to sudden death! #MKR'
maybe someone will use Kat's weber #mkr"
one word to remember - bacon, bacon, bacon! Not fricken lamb meatballs, BACON, with maple syrup #mkr"

Step away from the Kat, kids...for your own safety.'
and Dave better win this! Bacon! #mkr'
Emilie leaves tonight I'm out #MKR okay maybe not but I'll be shattered"
who serves lamb meat-balls for breakfast ?'
Always good to sell your food by calling it 'left over food'. Genius Lloyd."
Sheri and Emilie #mkr'
Annie and Lloyds breakfast ... #mkr
where is this place? It's beautiful! #MKR"
like left over roast veggies".  Marketing isn\'t Lloyd\'s strong point.  #mkr'
is way too fancy - very rich and not something many kids will enjoy #MKR'
for breakfast. Not really a breakfast item. Saying that though I'd eat them #mkr"
that the best response to the hotcakes they managed to film was a non-committal "meh" from some adolescent. #MKR'
on earth would Bubble &amp; Squeak be considered appealing when you eat out? It's leftovers! I can do that myself and I'm a crap cook. #MKR"
I would have done spicy Mexican eggs with bacon &amp; roasted capsicum.'
25 minutes to the next bake....... yeah.... okay.....'
some of these contestants are idiots. Who eats meatballs in the morning ?'
and Lloyd have an Epiphany #mkr
gone for the sliced pony after all Annie. #mkr

@tomdcc that exists in web.'
oh god that sounds like a horrible idea. privacy problems. also, twitter likely wouldn't be storing the number. that would be bad."
twitter clients and web are supposed to have the same tools/exp. that's why devpolicy doesn't really encourage 3rd party clients."
you don't have to have a phone to get SMS. you have to have internet. which is also required for twitter."
it's really fun watching patterns emerge in all of this regarding various groups. i think it'll be useful."

@Spacekatgal they don't do this right now. i mean, unless you are becoming verified."

@TsundereRager automated programs, whatever. it's not clearly written."

worry, i\'m sure no one will be like "WHAT A GREAT IDEA" until a dude takes credit for it. &lt;3'
@TsundereRager Unclear. ToS prevents bots from being able to contact you without you contacting them first, iirc.'
@teh_maxh it sets a bad precedent.'
i've seen some strong proof that people in the middle east are using online solutions for SMS."
it makes sense to ask for donations to keep it up and going, and to pay for the dev work. ideally, this is 100% crowd-funded.'

yup. I know the drill.'
@metsfan anything that requires a government ID is a privacy concern. anything that requires money is a bad idea forever.'

@_peech: How @therealroseanne sees trans ppl and sex workers. Nice #feminism u got there, lady.
had her chance to understand, but she's decided to dig in her heels. Whelp. Lesson learned, eh?"
think that it won't go unnoticed/unchallenged. Don't put on a cape unless you plan on being a hero. It's not a photo op. It's a job."

@GordonGuano: @freebsdgirl I am really curious as to why someone would try to sell their own children for crystal meth.'
reached out to @ninaburleigh with concerns the day the article was published. No response. Nina cares more about page views than problems.'
given the *massive* glee i'm seeing from GG irt that tweet, it's concerning that he's not retracting or explaining 'bully'"
been offered contact info from those he's speaking with should he care to contribute. He's utilized none of this. I am unimpressed."
@shanemadden: @freebsdgirl It's about ethics in controllers on dogs.
to @ninaburleigh, we should be happy that dudes are talking about feminism. Even if they are telling us how we are doing it wrong.'
you should see his guilty look.'
and i couldn't give less fucks about alienating followers by giving them an opinion they don't like."
no pile-ons. Don't tweet at him, etc. I think the conversation is concerning in that we need to discuss what bully means."
honestly do not understand the attacks on this man." - @ninaburleigh on @wadhwa.'
that's an awesome name! :P"

this moment in time, I am unaware of any effort he has made into this space. I'm tied in w/many orgs. His name has never once come up."
this is what you just said. you just compared online harassment to mutilated bodies. this is demeaning.'
go fuck yourself. &lt;3'
appreciate every donation received. But ppl that threaten to pull funding if I don't say the things they want to hear can fuck themselves."
many toys can be stacked on his head?
also been told that some of the people mentioned in @ninaburleigh's article didn't even talk to her. She quoted them without asking."
if i was looking for pitchforks, i'd point out a white dude in a position of power accused a minority of bullying him. :P"
don't change my views to get money. That's not how this works. @PeerWorker"

the thing I said to an account that was a confirmed sockpuppet that was supposed to infiltrate SJWs? lol.'

am really curious as to why @GI_AndyMc is throwing around accusations of bullying when someone expresses an opinion irt writing direction.'
tbh, i feel bad anytime anyone actively enters this fight without knowing about the personal cost.'
thank you for calling me on this, though. i probably should have made that more clear in the original tweets.'
bought crepes but I don't really know what they are so I am just going to call this a fruit burrito.
@Spacekatgal @GI_AndyMc THANK YOU RANDOM INTERNET PERSON FOR INSERTING YOURSELF WHEN I SAID NO PILE-ONS.'
is 50 shades of bullshit. Wadhwa said that women that disagreed with him were just looking for attention. THESE WERE HIS WORDS.'

am really curious as to why there are people stupid enough to believe that Encyclopedia Dramatica is ethical journalism. @GordonGuano'
@krisaubuchon holy shit. seriously? i've done research into both groups. I've seen the tweets &amp; patterns. GamerGate isn't ISIS."
most of my oreilly books are ebooks. :P  those are all so old. but yes, i usually quite like them.'
is fine, I guess. But she went out of her way to talk to wadhwa. Interesting, no?'
it\'s a little irritating to see some guy with a huge following come along and say "I\'m gonna do stuff!" and then... do nothing.'
oh. i've got him blocked. i didn't even see that."
i had a bunch of clip on hair extensions from when i had longer hair. decided to let him use them. ;)'
twitter you are killing me with dumb this morning.'
is currently a vocal male on twitter that claims to be all about anti-harassment. He has defended GamerGate in the past.'
@ninaburleigh @wadhwa lol, she was one of the people that gave him a platform and then ignored detractors.'
haha, mine is worse. :P'
talking about people that take an active stand to say they want to create solutions for harassment, but do nothing beyond get RTed."
one said threats weren't serious. However, there's a difference between ISIS and GamerGate. @PeerWorker"
@deathofrats01 his face is a bit differently structured. he looks a lot like a collie in some regards.'
online harassment is a serious problem, and it needs to be addressed. but making false equivalencies won't get you anywhere."

me make this super fucking clear. I will not compromise my beliefs in any way just to get donations. That isn't happening, ever."
no. dog treats.'
LOOKING AT YOUR ICONS, JUDGINGGGGG'
I'm not going to say GamerGate is the same as ISIS, and you can shove your donation up your ass. @PeerWorker"
it depends on how you define meaningful. if 3 people listen to you vs 30k, there's a huge difference in voice."
the use of the word 'bully' in this context is worrisome and relevant to any conversation i have."
doesn't drive, but is in many cases an accurate reflection."

ran out of things to put on his head. sorry.'
@PeerWorker: @freebsdgirl Why is there a double standard with terrorists from #ISIS being prosecuted quickly while harassers of #GamerGa'

yup! probably a mix of some sort. he's from the shelter. :)"
this is an ally, then fuck everything &amp; set the world on fire. @ninaburleigh was dumb enough to get sucked into his bullshit vortex.'
well, something happened. A hashtag was started by harassers to support him. So, that's something. I guess."
@StephenAtWar: @freebsdgirl \n\nu right now
@MetroidThief: @freebsdgirl
@PeerWorker: @freebsdgirl The threats are either serious or they aren't.  I guess you don't view #GamerGate as emotional terrorism."
so am i, tbh. it took a few tries to make it balance.'
uh. because one group is literally killing people? are you nuts?'
i'm a little concerned. the tweet still exists. i see no retraction published."
twitter search for my name and "set yourself on fire" and see if i give two shits about what you think.'
@ninaburleigh who are you referring to with 'we'?"
to be clear, i'm not bringing this up to defend bri. i'm aware that she's fully capable of defending herself."
as someone that went from ~4k followers to what i've got now, i've seen a huge difference."
yes. given that one group routinely posts mutilated bodies on twitter along with american passports, i'd say they are worse."
@DanielleIsANerd it was up on 8chan. someone probably has an archive somewhere.'

this was questioned, I should be clear. I'm not talking about supporters, or just people with opinions."

completely disagree. it's industry recognition."
@KayinNasaki @tehrebound that's a hoax."
@EvvyKube Nope. You keep saying that, but we both know you're lying. Show me where I called you stupid."

that's fine. ^.^"
far, the primary response I\'ve heard from the FreeBSD dev community in regards to all of this is "how can we help?"'

then there's this person, who suggests PC-BSD because FreeBSD are all sjws.

thing is, you don't actually have to say any of that stuff for us to figure out who it's coming from. It's easy to track social groups."
not at GDC today, but I'll be there tomorrow. ;D"

anything i say publicly gets quoted by the press. randi@randi.io.'

that is a lot harder. developer policy prohibits it.'

eek (also hi, i followed you because you're awesome. &lt;3)"
can you send it up? i'm not exactly at my computer right now."
built-in would be good. i can do more with 3rd party services than i can by providing a client, in the meanwhile.'

@jcherkis: Thanks @Pahlkadot for the great talk  @Microsoft about digital government and @codeforamerica
it is absurd how much of my amazon wish list consists of socks.'

@drurbanski
hahaha, my favorite thing ever is shopping for fun socks. :)'
i got sick, but i have work to do. solution? i just went out and bought a 6 lb brisket. All problems can be solved with more meat.'

Almost forgot, need to submit to CFP for #osbridge. :)'
i'm also quite curious about this, and wondering about the radio silence from @Jeff_Skalski"

an idea. How about the ability to mute someone for N period of time?"

ooo, i like that.'
yo, check out  It has helped me SO MUCH with eyestrain.'
@Phoenix_Blue blocked you? i thought she blocked someone else.'
iirc, tweetbot is a paid app. :)  i'm not necessarily thinking full-fledged client."
i'm mostly pondering a few startup incubators that are now accepting non-profit applications."
was a comment taken from Polygon's article on the #1RTB panel.
it would auto-unmute after N hours, or whatever.'
a lot of talk about GDC vs PAX. I felt safer at GDC post-GamerGate than I did at PAX pre-GamerGate. So, there's that."
@athenahollow @twoscooters are not exactly on speaking terms.'

i don't think so. it was just found."
that's a markov bot. not a human."

what does that have to do with anything?'
i've been mostly ignoring it, but she's clearly fixated and making weird accusations. has never once directly talked to me."

also a few famous people followed me and now i'm freaking out that i tweet too much &amp; don't want to scare them off. :P"
ok. whenever you've calmed yourself, poke me on facebook and i'll tell you why it's a problem w/the code base."

that's how it works with a private account."

heard it correctly. 1:57:20.
i got spells for that.'
@athenahollow meh. i have a couple of pathfinder modules, but it's not really my thing."
use my Aria. I get emails w/their weight. Sometimes, when we're playing card games, I'll silently mouth the number at them. I win."
that was my intention. :P'
no doubt. i don't really have the time for lawsuits, so it's a question of resource allocation vs benefit."

@GlennF i almost typed "is it in the cloud" forgetting that i have keyboard input word replace for cloud to butt.'
@tmclaughbos it's not internet rules. it's the way the code is written..."

hey, if you toss me more info about that, i can pass it up the chain to enforcer type people. it would be appreciated.'
how am I the only person that caught this? This just confirms my belief that I'm the only person that watches the morning news."

not really concerned when it comes to gaters being gatery about *me*, but regarding this org, that's a problem."
on one hand, the only voice she has is with gaters - which doesn't really affect OAPI's reach."

from WA? Yeah. You can easily do it in 2 days. I'd recommend taking a break just after hitting the CA border."
Here is an ISIS medical student at work.
Again, you jump to unsupported conclusions, just like your absurd coup idea.'

men are the ones that are going to push the real change. they are the ones in power, generally. we need their help.'


@ChristophHeer52 ... Nazi ideological indoctrination. And wiki will tell you that half the world's neo Nazis live in Russia."

@SwatiGauri It's Islam aftermath, microbrain.  It's always been that way."
@miskelayla Pilgars repetition of the Russian propaganda line about Ukrainian Nazis is an insufferable lie.'

@ChristophHeer52 First, Bandera fought for Nazis, but he was also in a Nazi prison.'
@YouTube
@miskelayla The idea that the US is trying to provoke Russia in light of Russian invasion of Crimea and E. Ukr. is absurd.'

There are a few Kurds who betrayed their people and joined the Daesh criminals. And a few stayed and live in fear.'
Nothing but an idiotic headline.'
Are you hoping for a lot of dead civilians to serve your propaganda goals?'

90% of all human inventions and science happened in the last 100 years.  Virtually nothing from Muslims.'
So what is your solution Buckey, just let ISIS take over the world, or do you just like being sanctimonious?'
With that kind of lack of reality contact, I can now see why you joined ISIS.'

@AkEl_Saruman Taqiyya BS from the Islamoliars.'
There was no random bombardment with chemical weapons. The ISIS chemical weapons were blown up.'
So they are loosing more than 36,000 per year. The Peshmerga guess was an overestimate and included future draft from Mosul.'
Media lies? What media lies.  Tell me there is not a place with human heads on a stake and that women are not forced home.'
That Jews are controlling the world is one of those idiotic conspiracy theories Muslims use to hide their failure.'
@niqash: More on the gas cloud over #Mosul that caused locals to panic. Mosul Eye blogger says it was #ISIS bomb gone wrong.
So the comeback is, "we are only loosing a little bit". But the important thing is ISIS heavy loss of men and weapons.'
Since both the Daesh and your prophet murdered women and children, you are talking like a hypocrite.'

@_Kurda_ I'll have to settle for the 300 winchester mag I'm building."
The cowards are the ones hiding behind the civilians in Mosul instead of going to meet the Pesh that are right there.'

Gwer is a good example. Daesh had a good plan of attack, but not the manpower to make it stick. So they lost resources.'

@PeterTownsend7: Once again we hear that groups like ISIS \'pervert Islam\'. To which we are surely entitled to ask: "How exactly?"
@Rudd1971 I know that you will try.'
@halalflaws @biebervalue @greenlinerzjm Tell me what your Quran 33:33 says?'
@nyazpolitics @greenlinerzjm Then why doesn't she know that her prophet called women stupid and corrupt."
@versacezaynx @nyazpolitics All the Hadiths that I gave you come from the Muslim students of USC Hadith website.'
@haroonstyles @halalflaws @greenlinerzjm @biebervalue What does your Quran 33:33 say?'
@halalflaws @biebervalue No they are treated worse. Can't drive in Saudi. Can't leave home without man in many Muslim countr."
@haroonstyles @halalflaws @greenlinerzjm @biebervalue Come on. Let's do it one verse at a time. Everybody verify what it says."
@greenlinerzjm You are a filthy liar. Slavery is explicitly approved in Islam and raping slave girls is explicitly approved.'
@halalflaws @biebervalue Come on morons, let's all go to the same verses in our own Quran. Start with 33:33. Are you afraid?"
@greenlinerzjm Hey, dumb shit, I read the entire Quran. You read some garbage that an Imam gave you to fool people.'
@AMohedin @islamdefense @haroonstyles @greenlinerzjm No, it says this.
Go to Wiki and read the section about the attack on Karbala.  Search "scaled the walls"'
@greenlinerzjm @halalflaws @biebervalue Let's try something different. Pick up your Quran and read 33:33. Tell me what it says"
@haroonstyles @halalflaws @greenlinerzjm @biebervalue We can get to that later. Let's stick with one issue and cover it. 33:33?"
@haroonstyles @halalflaws @greenlinerzjm @biebervalue Stop changing subjects. What does your 33:33 say?'
@greenlinerzjm No, lying dumbass, she was older than him and already had her fortune when she met him and hired him.'
@biebervalue @halalflaws @greenlinerzjm What does your Quran's 33:33 say?
And it tells women not to display themselves, right?'
Pact of Umar.  Should we make Muslims in the west live by such a pact in reverse?'
I believe you mean well, but you are incorrect about Islam. We will have to agree to disagree. Good night.'
@haroonstyles @halalflaws @greenlinerzjm @biebervalue Here are 5 translations of 33:33. What is yours?
If you had a brain you would be ashamed.
@versacezaynx @nyazpolitics Thanks for proving my point about Muslims knowing little about Islam.'
@greenlinerzjm You have presented a pile of lying crap that does not come from the Quran or Hadiths.'
No it is only talking to women. So are the Taliban and ISIS and Saudis not implementing 33:33 when they force women home?'
@halalflaws @biebervalue More Muslim women being treated like Queens.
It tells women to stay at home right?
@halalflaws @biebervalue @greenlinerzjm Tell me what your Quran 33:33 says.'
@greenlinerzjm @biebervalue Islam says stay in your home microbrain. It's the same thing.
@halalflaws @biebervalue @greenlinerzjm Tell me what your Quran 33:33 says.'
@MelBiebs69 @biebervalue @greenlinerzjm What does your Quran 33:33 say?'
@greenlinerzjm Exactly.
Finally some Abrams were used the way they were intended to be used.'
@nyazpolitics @greenlinerzjm You are too stupid to talk to. Blocked.'
@greenlinerzjm Every single thing out of your mouth is Taquiyya. Blocked.'
So when Taliban make women stay home and wear Burquas are they not implementing 33:33?'
@greenlinerzjm @halalflaws Another lying dim wit. She was engaged when she was 6 and he screwed her a 9
@halalflaws @biebervalue More Muslim women treated like Queens.
Every time some deluded idiot converts to Islam the muslims make propaganda out of it.'
@nyazpolitics @greenlinerzjm I'm not interested in your childish OMGs."
I don't see your 33:33. Only something about a house and can't breath. What does that have to do with 33:33."
When the Taliban make women wear Burquas are they not preventing women from "displaying themselves"?'
@islamdefense @AMohedin @haroonstyles @greenlinerzjm This is your tweet. It is not 33:33.
@halalflaws @biebervalue @greenlinerzjm I'm trying to get us a starting point. Give me 33:33 from your own Quran."
@biebervalue @greenlinerzjm But you are so stupid that you don't even know where to find Hadiths."
@biebervalue @greenlinerzjm Are you so stupid that you don't know how to find your own Hadiths and Quran verses?"
Can we all agree that 33:33 tells women to stay at home?'
@buell003 @i_magpie @Jeannie_Hartley We will.
@nyazpolitics @greenlinerzjm Why doesn't she know that her prophet said that most dwellers of hell were women?"
@halalflaws @greenlinerzjm @biebervalue Yeah, Cheney was in the burqua selling business.'
@urgedharry @nyazpolitics Again, showing you know nothing about Islam.
@biebervalue @greenlinerzjm Some lying Imams put together a package of Taqiyya and wrapped it in a pretty pink bow to sucker you'
@halalflaws @greenlinerzjm @biebervalue What does your Quran 33:33 say?'
@biebervalue @greenlinerzjm You didn't learn anything about the religion. Some Imam fed you a raft of lies to get you to convert"
@greenlinerzjm @halalflaws @biebervalue No Muslim women created a University.'
@nyazpolitics @greenlinerzjm I've been debating Islam with Muslims for years. Most know little about their religion,microbrain"
@pixieyas @versacezaynx @nyazpolitics Your knowledge of Islam is worse than zero because it's all Imam fed lies."
Stop making up lies. Show me with a verse.'
@biebervalue @greenlinerzjm Your Imams write crap on a piece of paper and you think it comes from Hadith or the Quran.'
@biebervalue @greenlinerzjm It's blazingly obvious that all you kids have been hand fed your opinions about Islam by some Imam."
@greenlinerzjm Again you are a lying piece of shit and I will prove it.
@greenlinerzjm you are the lying piece of shit. I gave you evidence for everything I said from Quran. You gave nothing but lies'
@greenlinerzjm @halalflaws @biebervalue Show me the Hadith where you get your information. I'm waiting."
@islamdefense @halalflaws @haroonstyles @greenlinerzjm And what does your Quran 33:33 say. Come on. Anybody.'
@haroonstyles @halalflaws @greenlinerzjm @biebervalue Do the Taliban lock women up at home like 33:33 tells them?'
@riwired: .@RobbieSingh2 @BBC only has rules for not mentioning and protecting Islam, Islamists &amp; jihadist. They love to abuse #Hindu ho'
@versacezaynx @nyazpolitics You are beyond stupid. You believe your Imam and research nothing.'
And 100% of Jews and Christians were exterminated in Saudi and other places.'
@biebervalue @greenlinerzjm Again, you present your Imam's propaganda. You have no Hadiths or verses."
@versacezaynx @nyazpolitics Here is the truth about slavery.
Or I can go to the proven barbaric attitudes of Muslims as an excellent reason to hate Islam.
@ibnkafka @imran273jr @MaxBlumenthal Sure, that's a good excuse."
@halalflaws @islamdefense @haroonstyles @greenlinerzjm Why?'
@rudoren The Israelis should demand back the 40% of the Arabian peninsula that the Muslims stole from them.'
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm I cut out 4:34 in Arabic and stuck it into Google translate.'
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm You can deny it until I prove it.'
@rudoren There is absolutely no reason for Israel to give up an inch of land since that will get them nothing from Muslims.'
@haroonstyles @AMohedin @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm I got help. Five professional translators that all say strike.'
Even Pickthall, who is an Englishman, was a Muslim convert.'
Good night.'
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm And because of 4:34, beating would not be a reason in a Sharia court.'
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm I would have to do a search, so let's forget that one for now."
@AMohedin @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm What does your 2:282 say?
Would it be irony if the name was Vile_Naziism. In the same way it's not irony when it's Vile_Islam."
ROFL. Now there is a load of Putin manufactured bullshit if I ever saw one.'
Apparently the Iranian fascist Ayatollahs run it.'
No, not going to bed with her is a seperate option. There is no "mentally".'
@halalflaws @islamdefense @haroonstyles @greenlinerzjm What does your 4:34 say? Same as these?
We can get that much from the Quran. So maybe the Hadiths can help us clarify.'
@MadDr11
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Who's translation are you using?"
Okay, so let's try one more verse. What does your 2:282 say?
@haroonstyles @AMohedin @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm I read the whole. It doesn't change 33:33 at all."
No, it clearly says to beat them. The rest are other options. "Beat them" is there in black and white. Not what you say.'
@RudawEnglish: #KRG minister of #Peshmerga: today's victories in #Kirkuk achieved by the support of coalition airpower and Iraqi army ha"
So these are Hadiths that I copied from the USC Muslim students Hadith database. Look them up for yourself.
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm In that Hadith it says the reason is that women lack intelligence.'
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Beating her was not recommended, but allowed.'
@proadstudio: Why deny facts straight from the Palestinian horse's mouth? @munnerlyn33 @NuritBaytch @themillieneal @MaxBlumenthal
@fai3an_H Old enough not to be fooled by religious frauds.'
@MadDr11 Yeap, breeding and violence are the only thing they do well.'
And by the way, I'm not Jewish or Israeli. If I were I would announce it proudly."
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Why do you think all the translators use strike?'
No, he was killed because of negative comments about Putin.'
Yes, I hate the religion of hate.'
He was killed because Putin wanted him dead. The rest is a blatantly obvious Putin coverup.'
But the five professional translators, many of them Muslims, do know Arabic. For some it is their first language.'
@Larryputt: Islam Or Else? Really That's What They Are taught! To pray those who Earned Anger &amp; Those That Have went Astray!
@MaxBlumenthal What do you think you are spreading, Muslim bigot.
And here we have it.  What does your 4:34 say?
Just block me and stop crying.'
And hating Islam is rational, and therefore not a phobia.
But the Quran says that verses can be abrogated, right? Now let's get to compulsion later. What does 4:34 say?"
@biebervalue @liamxkiwi @greenlinerzjm @halalflaws I know that if your husband divorces you he get's control of kids."
@greenlinerzjm @biebervalue I doubt that a single person on the Supreme Court knew what Sunnah or Hadith meant.'
@MadDr11 @MaxBlumenthal
And the prophet ruined their faith by raping them.'
@haroonstyles @AMohedin @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Only two verses and we are making progress.'
@MadDr11 @MaxBlumenthal No, they are not Muslims.
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Google translate used the word "beat". I hope that settles it.'
@greenlinerzjm @halalflaws @biebervalue Sorry, I block cretins.'
There is not and never has been a country called Palestine, microbrain. And that land has been the home of Jews for 3000 years.'
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm But let's go on to the Hadith that refers back to 2.282."
You are a liar. The Palestinians never had a country and the Jews were settled, not Bedouins.'
Muslims need to get off the land they stole from the Jews now.'
@biebervalue @liamxkiwi @greenlinerzjm @halalflaws I know Saudis chased girls into a burning building.
@haroonstyles @AMohedin @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm beyond the five translators,here is Google translate
@MaxBlumenthal @rudoren @nytimes Hey, it's what your prophet Mohammed actually did, not just talk about. So what is your problem?"
@MaxBlumenthal Muslims celebrating international women's day.
@islamdefense Stay on 33:33 until we agree what it says.
That explains his dedication to Islam.'
Thanks for parading your racism.'
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm I've got 4 translations that say hit and one that says scourge."
@haroonstyles @halalflaws @AMohedin @greenlinerzjm You might like to watch this.  Have a nice day.'
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm I'll give it to you again.
@islamdefense @AMohedin @haroonstyles @greenlinerzjm You are babbling. 33:33 says this.
It doesn't require muscles to be a witness. So can we assume the lack is mental or emotional."
@biebervalue @liamxkiwi @halalflaws Female slavery in Saudi.
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm The translators knew Arabic, so they are right.'
@rudoren Interesting that Kurds are fighting for their own land but the Islamist who support Palestine oppose the Kurds.'
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Here is a screen shot of what I got.
@MaxBlumenthal @maxkeiser Is it one of these children?
@MaxBlumenthal No they don't. 40% of the Arabian peninsula belonged Jews before the Muslims began exterminating them. Give it back."
@MaxBlumenthal @rudoren @nytimes Showing that you are a liar since there is zero evidence.'
4:34 is in the Quran not the Hadith. And you don't explain why 5 translators would use strike."
@hxhassan Yeah. It's a generous sentiment. But it's not true."
@greenlinerzjm @halalflaws @biebervalue Another Muslim blowhard. The average GDP in Saudi is less than the US. And women r slaves'
What "along side"?'
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm So your claim is that me are physically superior, right?'
@DavidAWeinberg: 9 minutes of excruciating 9/11 conspiracy theories by preacher who recently was handed Islam award by #Saudi king:
@biebervalue @liamxkiwi @halalflaws
@fai3an_H No, delusional one, you look like the giant fool.'
Not unless you can get 5 professional translators to agree.'
@jihadwatchRS:  Robert Spencer in PJ Media: Muslim Holidays in New York Public Schools: Why Not?'
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm So I decided to give you one more chance even beyond the 5 translators.'
@fai3an_H And I don't walk in circles around a black meteor in Mecca under the delusion that it will please god."
@stevesalaita Screaming in pure religious hatred, "Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar"'
@haroonstyles @AMohedin @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Not talking about what you choose to do. I'm talking about what Islam says."
In fact, it was the Jews that settled Medina before the Arabs. Then the Muslims exterminated them.'
@haroonstyles @AMohedin @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Actually he hit Aisha. But I don't have time for that now."
@biebervalue @liamxkiwi @greenlinerzjm @halalflaws
@biebervalue @liamxkiwi @greenlinerzjm @halalflaws I don't have to live there to know you can't drive."
Or I can go directly to the Quran and Hadith for great reasons to hate Islam.
@TRobinsonNewEra: This has nothing to do with islam then?
@RTUKnews @RT_com I find that it's the people who claim others don't know anything about Islam that don't know anything."
Liar!
@biebervalue @liamxkiwi @greenlinerzjm @halalflaws I know you can't leave country without male permission."
There could be an antiIslamophobic, however. And that would be you.'
