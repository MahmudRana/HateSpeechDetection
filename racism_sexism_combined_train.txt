@wood_brwood333 For example, in Medina Mohammed said, kindly cut off the heads of these 600 Jewish men and enslave their women.'
Again, your entire concept of god corresponds to a tyrannical earthly egomaniac because you are simple and stupid. #Islam'
Your prophet was a rapist, murderer, pedophile, caravan robber, slave trader, bigot and sexist. God would never use the scum.'

Exactly.  Merkel is defending this.  And the protesters are called Islamophobes for being against it.
@arennie44 Of course it is #Islam.  The Quran approves of both slavery and the rape of female slaves.
Muslims a woman walking down the street is a giant vagina demanding to be raped if she is not covered by a tent.
@RKingLive2Dance @izrinhariri But the fact that Islam is a declaration of war means that Islam will always produce terrorists.'

@Juliet777777: Norway sees huge drop crime as large number  Muslim illegals deported   @FrancsPays @DutchDL @OZzSu'
@riwired @izrinhariri Because Islam has over 100 operating terrorist groups and a mandate to conquer the world by violence.'
The command to fear Allah is all through the Quran.  The ritual of groveling on the ground is one of fear. No personal relationship'

who disagree with Jihad are attacked by Muslims.  So where are these moderate Muslims?  #Islam

Idiots like you making such declarations have no contact with reality.  Islam is inhuman and must be outlawed.'
Nothing desperate about it. Humanity realizes now that Islam declared war on it 1400 years ago and Islam will be destroyed.'
And Muslims are expected to fear god as well.  If living in fear is your idea of perfect, you are stupid.'

Yes, might, power, and imperialism is what it is all about.  There is zero spirituality in it.  Soon the world will understand.'
What do customs and rules and history have to do with it.  Marrying a 6 year old and screwing a 9 year old is sick like Islam.'
ROFL.  No one with a brain will want a madrassa education.  Will they teach Mohammed's remedies?
Exactly.  #Isam is a cult of death centered around the idea of going to a heaven that is described to be a giant whore house.'

Drasko just said he was impressed the girls cooked half a chicken.. They cooked a whole one  #MKR'
@SwatiGauri When an Islamolunatic blows himself up in Baghdad, it has zero to do with Bush and Blair.'

Keep repeating and believing your brain dead fairy tales - and follow your prophets medical advice.

Exactly.  Read the Quran and the Hadiths and find out for yourself how hateful, bigoted, sexist, vile and inhuman #Islam is.'
@arennie44 Furthermore, Islam demands that women be locked in their homes and covered. Stop lying.
ISIS follows what is in the Quran and the Hadiths and Sharia exactly, to the letter. #Islam'

@IronmanL1 @stevecorrales80 And yet it is a law of Islam and 1/3 of Muslims support that law. But you tell me to tolerate em'
You can preach coexistence all you want.  To Islamist you are just a useful idiot.'
That's an excuse and a cop out.  Every single Islamic nation is repressive. They produce either dictators or theocrats."
And no one is entitled to a belief that denies other people their believes.
Here is what the scumbag Muslims do with children.  And then they use them for propaganda.
@TheMuslimGuy Do you think that the cretins at Salon understand Mohammed's declaration of war on humanity? No
Screw Francis.  Any Pope that will not stand up for freedom of speech should not be Pope.  Get rid of the clown.'
Yes, all of the land the Muslims have they got by butchering the inhabitants. And they are depraved psychopaths.'
All the Christians and Ezidis that are told to leave or convert or die are forced.'
@SumbelinaZ @IronmanL1 @Hatewatch The mess was there long before the US. The entire history of Islam is murder
I agree.  He is just like the prophet Mohammed.'
These are all excuses to hide the fact that you are following an evil and inhuman religion.'
Even Muslims talk about forcing children to become Muslims. It's not a big secret.
@IronmanL1 @stevecorrales80 So, are people who support murder for apostacy guilty of anything?
And all the hatred was started by your pedophile prophet.  Now you are finally getting it back.
@Loretta778: @tdw1116 @Salon The terrorists themselves trumpet their allegiance to Allah and their religion. It's stupid to pretend away"
@PeterTownsend7: #islam #isis Allah the Mutilator. Can you feel the 'peace' yet?
You have to be an idiot to think that you can follow an ideology of murder, imperialism, hatred and have people like you for it'
is ISIS obsessed with beheadings? Because their terrorist prophet Mohammed had 600 men beheaded in one day.#Islam
The stupidity of Jihadis who think that you only need guns to run a civil society.'
@BOU_JASSIM That is because Islam is stuck in the seventh century.'
@SumbelinaZ @IronmanL1 @Hatewatch For example, 80% of all civilians killed in Afghanistan are killed by Taliban.'
@TheMuslimGuy Objecting to this is what the PC morons of Salon call racism.
@TheMuslimGuy Do you think that the mindless little bozos at Salon understand that  Quran is full of bigotry.
@SumbelinaZ @IronmanL1 @Hatewatch Why would you profile white people. Blacks murder at 6 times the rate as whites.'
@IronmanL1 @stevecorrales80 What do you think we are doing when we accept Muslim immigrants.  What do we get back.'
@essel1 You mean hapless genocidal Palestinian Islamolunatics that are determined to erase Israel from the map?'
This is another clear expression of how Islam thinks of women being owned by men.'
@IAmThe1Teacher @stevecorrales80 I don't think so. But we do need to outlaw Islam."
You can't get any sicker than the Muslim animals following the instructions of their pedophile prophet.
@TheMuslimIssue Saudi Arabia - a nation of Islamolunatics hiding from the Islamolunatics they helped to create. #Islam'
@TheMuslimGuy Objecting to this is what the PC morons of Salon call racism. #Islam
Before the murdering prophet Mohammed came along to exterminate them, Jews lived on 40% of the Arabian Peninsula.'
@SumbelinaZ @IronmanL1 @Hatewatch There have been 22,000 Islamic terrorist attacks since 9/11.'
@SumbelinaZ @IronmanL1 @Hatewatch And that doesn't count common crime in Muslim states."
Tell it to the Islamofascists.'
@SumbelinaZ @velvethammer @IronmanL1 @Hatewatch She is crying, "Boohoo, you are terrorizing our Islamic terrorists"'
And you get to put an X on the Islamic bullshit bingo card.
@SumbelinaZ You are lying. Most Muslims are still extremists.
If you are just going to sit there and tell lie after lie, Muslim Taquiyya, this discussion is over. You are blocked.'
@IronmanL1 @stevecorrales80 It's utterly stupid to  tolerate the intolerance of Islam."
@SumbelinaZ @IronmanL1 @Hatewatch The Department of Justice report says blacks kill at 6 times the rate of whites.'
Every child that is brainwashed and never given a choice is force.'
It's not what I think. It's what I have already proven to you multiple times."
True, no other ideology is as vile, murderous, backwards and stupid as Islam.'
Islam tells us that we must accept sexism. So I guess Muslim sexism must be accepted or you are racist.
@NNdabbour64 And if someone wants to leave Islam, then Islam declares him an apostate and demands that he be murdered.'
@JosephIsVegan @SumbelinaZ @IronmanL1 @Hatewatch There are over 100 Islamic terrorist groups. No other religion is close.'
Who manufactures all the rockets that the Palestinians fire at Israel? And who manufactures the terrorists Kalishnikovs?'
Here is a map of Israel inside all of the Muslim nations that want to destroy Israel and murder them.
@SumbelinaZ @IronmanL1 @Hatewatch And today the huge majority of death in Islamic states are done by Muslims.'
@IronmanL1 @IAmThe1Teacher Another guilt feeling fool.  Islam attacked and conquered 2/3 of Christianity before crusades.'
@TheMuslimGuy Objecting to this is what the PC morons of Salon call racism.
Every Muslim who is forced to stay in Islam by the law of apostacy for murder is forced.'
Claiming that Islam is not a problem because states that are Islamic repress their citizens is a contradiction of ideas.'
@b_kisan: @TRobinsonNewEra Same country where conversion away from Islam is illegal.....one way street and a slow wiping out of non-Musl'
You animals are slitting throats and we are suppose to care that you are offended by cartoons.
A phony prophet trying to gain power through hatred and divisiveness is the reason for it.'
@TIB2016 @IronmanL1 @Hatewatch And what is the conspiracy? Islam states clearly that they want to murder
@stevecorrales80 @IronmanL1 So you want to be tolerant of "Islam" and intolerant of "religions"?'
Because the Muslims are mostly just as crazy.
@HuwGruffydd What is amazing is how often Allah's revelations met Mohammed desires, but no one became suspicious except Aisha."
I have no religion, but I can accommodate Jews, Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, Taoist, Atheists.  But Islam is too cancerous'
@stevecorrales80 @IronmanL1 Islam declared war on all humanity 1400 years ago.  And nothing has changed.'
@IronmanL1 @stevecorrales80 The Hindus tried a pacifist approach to Islam.  The Muslims responded by murdering 80 million.'
@TheMuslimGuy Any chance that Salon understands what most Muslims think about some very primitive ideas? No.
I know that they are forced into Islam by being brainwashed and never being given a choice.'
@epicloser Why should the world care when Islam declared war on all humanity 1400 years ago.'
You are basically claiming that a religion that teaches hatred and murder has nothing to do with hatred and murder. Dumb!'
@TalebAshrafi @iran_policy Do you think that they do it because the prophet Mohammed fought for plunder?'
That is a load of manure. It says the same thing in translation as it does in Arabic. It is still a pile of hatred and murder.'
man thrown off the rooftop by ISIS for being gay.  Despite what the radical left claims, this is the real #Islam.
@IronmanL1 @IAmThe1Teacher The first crusades were Muslims invading Spain and France - 400 years before European Crusades.'
The same old lie about property rights.  But Arab women had those before Islam.'
And of course the Palestinians are firing rockets at Israel without any regard for what they hit, including women and children.'
I haven't seen Jews go on killing rampage against holocaust deniers. Violence is Islam's answer to everything
Here is how Muslims treat non Muslims. So fuck the genocidal Palestinians.
@JosephIsVegan @SumbelinaZ @IronmanL1 @Hatewatch Muslims are not a race, they are a murder cult.
Yes, people can believe what they want. But Islam doesn't give them that choice."
@TIB2016 @IronmanL1 @Hatewatch Nobody said anything about Jews, racist.  We are talking about Islam and Muslims here.'
The Quran spend 1/3 of it\'s space hating on "unbelievers".  That\'s hard to put aside.
And don't talk to me about hatred when you follow the vulgar Quran and Hadiths that are full of hatred."
@IronmanL1 @Hatewatch Name the last person the KKK killed, and you can find 100,000 that have since been killed by Islamists.'
If Quran and Hadith are full of hatred and murder and if Muslims support Sharia, then the problem is Islam and screw leftists.'
Islam is a good place for criminals to find a home.'
Islam is the only religion that has large forces of religious police running around telling people what they must do.'
@sudixitca: Some people work very hard to make this world a better place, while others work very hard to book a drink and sex party in t'
Islam is about as perfect as Nazism.'
Okay, and what are you going to make the other 100 Islamic terrorists groups equivalent to?'
No, I keep giving you proof and you ignore it.  Where is Islam's respect?  Go and read the pact of Umar."
I know the truth. It is 280 million citizens of the earth murdered by scum shouting "Allahu Akbar".'
@NNdabbour64 Most people who become Muslims are either forced or pressured into it, and the children have no choice.'
@SallyTreadwell @Lg4Lg @IronmanL1 @Hatewatch This is debate about the vile religion of Islam, not about one country, microbrain.'
The prophet of Islam made his living robbing caravans.  So of course ISIS will make money stealing if they can.'
@Lithobolos @ZaibatsuNews All Muslims share an ideology that is spelled out as bigoted, sexist, imperialists, homophobic.'
LOL. It is common knowledge and there are countless reports about Muslim no go areas in Europe.  Just google it.'
@Lithobolos @ZaibatsuNews That should be true. But ISIS exists to follow the religion exactly.'
@PeterTownsend7: #muslim #ISIS #Islam No compulsion in religion. Unless you're a kid of course!
But Islam hates free speech.'
@Juliet777777: MUSLIMS Australia to form  Australian All-Muslim Army impose sharia law    #FFRNN #WAKINGUP @TedtBa'
The hatred against Jews and Christians and others was begun by Mohammed.
@ZaibatsuNews I don't care what they retracted. The no go zones are there.  Here is an example.
@scamp_faridxx The reason that is newsworthy is because the Muslim contribution is so much more often destructive.'
Islam killed it.'
No one ask for your pedophile serving propaganda, swine.'
They will all have no skills except jihad.'
@aminawadud Karen Armstrong kisses the criminal Mohammed's ass so that she can sell books."
Most Muslims instinctively understand that Islam cannot survive in light of day and must be protected by blasphemy laws #Islam'
Religion at gunpoint and allegiance at gun point.'
What is wrong with that, considering how the Sunni Arabs have been exterminating everyone else for 1400 years.'
The filthy Palestinians have attacked and murdered Jewish children in their schools in the past.  So fuck Palestinians.'
@Colonel_Shami The prophet Mohammed used catapults on cities, killing women and children. So you just called him a coward.'
The prophet Mohammed was illiterate, superstitions, and knew nothing but war, theft and slave trading.'
For example, Muslims claim Algebra, but the Greeks and Indians were making good progress on Algebra before Mohammed was born'
@PoliticalAnt @ZaibatsuNews ...Then suddenly their Muslim neighbors are persecuting them and stealing their property.'
Question is, why don't the German criminal prosecutors announce an investigation into Islam's incitement to hatred? #Islam"
The difference between the Daesh and the FSA is not that big.  The FSA are also Islamolunatics.'
@Lithobolos @ZaibatsuNews But Sharia is very sexist and 2/3 of Muslims want it.'
But Islam puts out the light and makes life too dark to bear.'
good books that document the depravity of Islam.
As would I.  But of course many Muslims live under theocracy. And where they are minorities they try to creep up to it.'
Actually, Islam is a fraudulent religion that was made up long after it was supposedly founded.
@ThePoliticalHat: The next successor to the Saudi throne will be the son of a slave girl
@jm111t In a lot of Muslim countries saying that Mohammed is flawed is blasphemy that would get you beaten.'
in Mosul executed 13 people for watching soccer game.  Muslims will go crazy about a Mohammed cartoon, but won't protest murder. #Islam"
LOL. The ME was very creative before Islam.  Most "Muslim" discoveries came from conquered Persians.'
@jm111t You are following the religion of ignorance with an illiterate prophet and you want to talk about spelling? LOL.'
@PoliticalAnt @ZaibatsuNews It's not about any specific individuals, but about an ideaology that will always produce terrorists."
Having read the Quran and Hadiths, I discovered that Islam is a murderous, bigoted, sexist, hate mongering cult.'
What's to understand. The Daesh have passed a law that people cannot leave Raqqa or Mosul because they are sewers of terror."
@jm111t The Sunnah of the prophet is the basis for Sharia law, along with the Quran.  And the Quran is woman hating.'
@EWErickson You babble like a moron while Muslims are throwing gays off buildings.'
This guy spouted one lie after another and there is no response in this video.  Just typical lying Muslim propaganda.'
@jm111t That's only because they don't follow Islam.  Islam tells women to stay at home.
@PoliticalAnt @ZaibatsuNews But there are very few of those. On the other hand, 2/3 of Muslims want barbaric Sharia.'
@PhxKen: SIR WINSTON CHURCHHILL: "ISLAM IS A DANGEROUS IN A MAN AS RABIES IN A DOG"
@PoliticalAnt @ZaibatsuNews And there is no Jihad and world domination in Judaism as there is in Islam.'
@jm111t All you are doing with your verses is proving sexism in Islam.'
@Lithobolos @ZaibatsuNews The prophet Mohammed declared war on all non Muslims 1400 years ago exactly to impose such.'
Choudary tells the truth about Islam. Islam has no spirituality. It is only about forcing the world to obey.
No the lies that I tell come directly from the Quran and Hadiths. Like declaration of war on humanity
@DorvalTony: @baykara7 Religion my ass. Death cult.
Look at the data dipwad, 2/3 want sharia law, which denies all rights to women and non Muslims.
@ElConfeti: SSSSHHH!  The silent Muslim majority, remains quiet.
Mullah Oktar is a liar and an Islamofanatic.  He hates the YPG for their secularism, so he makes up garbage about them'
@Politics_PR @FoxNews Look at the data, dipwad, 1/3 think that people who leave Islam should be killed.
You can't even imagine how I think because I cannot imagine how anyone would take such a vile religion as Islam."
@Colonel_Shami Mohammed hid behind a trench in Medina when the Meccan army showed up.  So I guess he was a coward for that also.'
@Lithobolos @ZaibatsuNews So you think you can hate all people of a certain ideaology - but not if it's Islam."
@FoxNews Islamic no go zones are common knowledge except to idiots like you.
@MaxAbrahms: Islamic State members say they're following Islam while non-Muslims who don't even read up on religion insist they're not."
Islam declared war on all humanity 1400 years ago.  It's time we recognize that and respond."
@cameIzzz The problem was not the communists atheism, but rather their totalitarianism, just like Islam.'
@Lithobolos @ZaibatsuNews So ISIS beheads because their prophet beheaded . ISIS rapes slaves because their prophet raped them.'
The cancer of Islam pushes even babies to begin thinking about murdering their fellow human beings.'
This guy spouted one lie after another and there is no response in this video.  Just typical lying Muslim propaganda. #Islam'
@PoliticalAnt @ZaibatsuNews And your attitude is to let creeping Sharia and sexism into Muslim areas of the west.'
@EWErickson The idea that no go zones are a right wing boogie man is stupid.  No go zones are real.'
Shia and Sunni are back to killing each other in Yemen, as they have done everywhere for 1400 years.  The gift of #Islam.'
No they don't they share a commitment to the barbarity of their religion.
attacked on campus for telling truth about Islam, the religion that cannot survive without killing speech.
@PoliticalAnt @ZaibatsuNews Your mantra about "a few" is stupid.  This proves it.
@Lithobolos @ZaibatsuNews Eh, they all ostensible follow the ideology of Islam. Radicals follow closely, others less so.'
Islam has contributed nothing to humanity but hatred, death, and destruction for a thousand years.'
What is there to teach? We both know that the Quran is a cult manual of hatred, imperialism, murder, sexism, and bigotry.'
@PoliticalAnt @ZaibatsuNews So are you saying that the Quran is wrong with this piece of bigotry?
Yeap, Islam is for ignorant butts.'
Love it when these idiot national leaders claim that terrorism has nothing to do with Islam, and  not one has read the Quran.'
Salahuddin was a general who fought for Islamic slavery.  What does that have to do with Kurds fighting for freedom today?'
What the Americans did in Iraq was allow the Iraqis to elect their leadership.  Sunnis and Shia killing each other is Islam.'
@jm111t Again, the woman must be obedient to the man, even if he is a fool and she is brilliant.  You are proving my point again.'
@EWErickson Yeah, unlike the Muslims who are executing gays by throwing them off buildings.'
The prophet Mohammed was a caravan robber who declared war on all humanity. Hope the Jews recover their stolen land.'
@AFP More left wing scum caving in to the violence of Islam.'
Next step, learning to ride a bicycle, and then learning to ride a camel.'
@Lithobolos @ZaibatsuNews No go zones are exactly acting to impose such microbrain.'
@PoliticalAnt @ZaibatsuNews There should be no freedom to impose your religion on others. And that is what Islam is about.'
of the pedophile prophets big battles was the battle of the trench in Medina. ISIS are trying to imitate that trick with a Mosul trench.'
@jm111t Women should have the same sexual rights as me, but Islam says they clearly don't."
And those few discoveries were made despite Islam, not because of it. Islam has contributed nothing to mankind in 1000 years'
And historians have actually made countless efforts to independently collaborate anything in Islam.  It's totally fabricated."
@Greg389: Theresa May today pleaded with #Jews not to leave. Jews build wealth, Muslims take welfare. Simple economics.

Islam is terror.  To fight terror you have to fight Islam. Your prophet and your god are both sick terrorists. #Islam'
stoning, beheading, shooting, throwing off buildings - ISIS is an orgy if sadistic, gruesome methods of murder. #Islam #Daesh'
@PoliticalAnt @ZaibatsuNews The violence is always initiated by the Muslims. Mohammed started it. Proof.
So they have to imprison the people of Mosul and not allow them to leave. Islam is a religion of slaves and slavery.'
@EatingMyPeaz Hamaz never stopped it's war on Israel.  Islam never stopped it's war on humanity."
The Quran writer imagined god as egotistical and as wanting to be worshiped and bowed to because he was unsophisticated.'

@98Halima @johnnygjokaj @cdnKhadija @rfrankh53 Like I said,that is a stupid comment that seeks to hide the vileness of  Islam'
Everyone else does not follow a pedophile prophet who owned 27 slaves, robbed caravans, and raped women - only Muslims.'
@Lisa_Marie74 Your prophet used catapults to attack cities, murdering women and children.  So what are you crying about?'
@johnnygjokaj @rfrankh53 @98Halima @BilalIGhumman Mohammed was murdering Jews before Zionism existed.'
They can't read, write, do math, or produce anything. But they can kill people, so they are good Muslims. #Islam"
@rfrankh53 @BilalIGhumman @johnnygjokaj The little girls draw the highest price because of your pedophile prophet.'
@98Halima @johnnygjokaj @cdnKhadija @rfrankh53 Honest and fair is that Islam is a religion of hate, murder,bigotry and sexism'
@AkEl_Saruman No he\'s not.  He\'s an idiot.  He retweets things like "nigger hunting licenses" that never existed. He\'s a fraud.'
@Colonel_Shami Polls show that the majority of Muslims are very primitive in their believes.
@OdiniaInvictus @BilalIGhumman @IsraeliRegime No the hatred was all started by Mohammed.
@BilalIGhumman @OdiniaInvictus @IsraeliRegime So the only way the problems of Islam can be fixed is to outlaw Islam.'
@OdiniaInvictus @BilalIGhumman @IsraeliRegime As a result of Muslim hatred, there are no Jews or Christians left in Saudi.'
@johnnygjokaj @cdnKhadija @rfrankh53 Proof Mohammed was a pedophile.
@Colonel_Shami The prophet Mohammed was a big murderer. He once beheaded 600 Jews in one day. ISIS does what he did.'
@Lisa_Marie74 Islam declared war on all mankind 1400 years ago, now Muslims cry like babies when others respond in kind.'
@BilalIGhumman @OdiniaInvictus @IsraeliRegime The Quran itself is the source of the hatred, murder, imperialism, sexism.'
@BilalIGhumman @johnnygjokaj @98Halima @cdnKhadija There is nothing that ISIS does that prophet Mohammed did not also do.'
@johnnygjokaj @cdnKhadija @rfrankh53 ISIS makes women cover and locks them up because that is what Mohammed did.'
@98Halima @johnnygjokaj @cdnKhadija @rfrankh53 A typical Muslim response is to excuse Muslim barbarity by pointing elsewhere.'
@LeonardoMaxwel1 Another barbaric aspect of Islam is to murder people for the way they were born.'
Islam, on the other hand fights to take away people's freedom and force them to obey an imaginary terrorist god."
@curdistani: ISIS intend turn war of Islamism into ethnic war of Pan Arabism&amp;Kurd in Mosul. As evidence show they are conducting Pan ara'
@johnnygjokaj @BilalIGhumman @98Halima @rfrankh53 The term Islamophobe makes as much sense as Naziophobe.'

Earthly tyrants want to be feared because for them fear is control and obedience.  The writer of the Quran was unsophisticated.'
@OdiniaInvictus @IsraeliRegime That old line of BS.  There are over 100 Islamic terrorist orgs. No other religion is close.'
@BilalIGhumman @OdiniaInvictus @IsraeliRegime Buddhist teaching does not contain violence, hatred, or jihad. Islam does.'
@johnnygjokaj @BilalIGhumman @98Halima @rfrankh53 Raping children is what Mohammed did.'
You must have found it in your imagination, because it doesn't exist in Islam."
@johnnygjokaj @BilalIGhumman @cdnKhadija @rfrankh53 ISIS wants to control the world because Mohammed wanted to control it.'
Islamic documentation is based on belief.  Historical documentation is based of factual research.'
Yahya flips out about PKK being communists.  But that is clearly no longer true. Just propaganda.

Mo expelled two Jewish tribes from Medina and stole their property.  The third tribe he beheaded all the men, enslaved the rest'

@BilalIGhumman @OdiniaInvictus @IsraeliRegime Can't expect honesty from people who follow a caravan robber."
@BilalIGhumman @johnnygjokaj @cdnKhadija @rfrankh53 The Quran was produced by a pedophile, slave trader, caravan robber, murderer.'
@OdiniaInvictus @IsraeliRegime That is why we are going secular, microbrain. And Islam is as disgusting as ever.'
Sharia - taking injustice to new heights.  #Islam
You will see that loss of men and weapons accelerate land loss in the next few months. The Kurds are on the Mosul doorstep.'
@arabthomness Mohammed was illiterate and superstitious and Islam's backwardness is catching up to it's Jihadis."

@arabthomness But this is a good lesson that you can't win in the 21st century with ignorant madrassa rats."
@JihadiA8 Sharia put the Muslim world 1000 years behind the rest of civilization and tortured minorities.'
The people studying Islam all have the IQ of a camel.  A ten year old could figure out that this religion is evil by design.'
Earthly tyrants are also egotistical and want everyone to admire them and bow down to them. So the Quran writer imagined god.'
is designed to be a crushing of the human spirit with laws that only provide one outlet - the brutalizing of non Muslims.'
My point is that there is nothing that ISIS does that Mohammed did not also do.  Both are sick and disgusting criminals.'
You are the one sitting in a black tent holding an AK, so don't talk to me about hate."
@PeterTownsend7: #isis #muslim #Islamophobia? I think the word you're searching for is #Islamorealism
Nope.  With #democracy man makes all the laws by vote; with #Islam, Allah makes all the laws by the sword.  The two cannot coexist.'
@johnnygjokaj @BilalIGhumman @cdnKhadija @rfrankh53 Nothing is more barbaric that the Muslims.
@LeonardoMaxwel1 Could that be because Islam declared war on humanity 1400 years ago?
@rfrankh53 @98Halima @BilalIGhumman @johnnygjokaj You do understand that Mohammed was a sexist?
@Colonel_Shami You are pandering to a religion that declared war on all humanity 1400 years ago.'
@BilalIGhumman @johnnygjokaj @cdnKhadija @rfrankh53 You like words. They all say Islam is vile.
@98Halima @johnnygjokaj @cdnKhadija @rfrankh53 The stupidist arguments are the ones rationalizing the barbarity of Islam.'
I've spent more time studying and thinking about religion than you've been alive.  I understand Islam perfectly."

@Jihadii8 Not to mention crushing poverty, endless violence, and legal forced marriage of 8 year old girls.'
Daesh price list for Yezidi and Christian sex slaves.
@98Halima @johnnygjokaj @cdnKhadija @rfrankh53 In Islam all the facts are also foul.
@BilalIGhumman @johnnygjokaj @cdnKhadija @rfrankh53 ISIS has slavery because the prophet Mohammed was a slave owner and trader.'
@BilalIGhumman @OdiniaInvictus @IsraeliRegime He didn't discuss their wealth, he discussed Islam's barbarity."
@BilalIGhumman @OdiniaInvictus @IsraeliRegime The problem with Islam is that it cannot be fixed and still be Islam.'
@SirajZarook @BilalIGhumman @IsraeliRegime No, Muslims follow a religion based on terrorism, not Jews.'
@SirajZarook @BilalIGhumman @IsraeliRegime I know about Judaism.  I don't recommend it.  But most Jews are secular."
@johnnygjokaj @BilalIGhumman @cdnKhadija @rfrankh53 And Muslims never progress. They are still barbaric.
@rfrankh53 @BilalIGhumman @johnnygjokaj @cdnKhadija If there was a Satan he would have invented Islam.'
@johnnygjokaj @cdnKhadija @BilalIGhumman @rfrankh53 The battles were won because Mohammed gave his thugs 80% of what they stole.'
@johnnygjokaj @BilalIGhumman @cdnKhadija @rfrankh53 As tiny as Israel is, the Muslims want it exterminated.

@cdnKhadija @BilalIGhumman @johnnygjokaj @rfrankh53 The logic of a retarded madrassa rat.'
You are right. The violent murdering Muslims are the only ones who understand the meaning of their religion.'
There is actual spirituality in Buddhism and Tao.  There is zero spirituality in Islam.'
@cdnKhadija @rfrankh53 @BilalIGhumman @johnnygjokaj If you had a brain it would be revolted by Islam.'

@TheAtlantic The Quran clearly and explicitly declared war on all humanity 1400 years ago.  So humanity must declare war on Islam.'
@Totenleserin @P_Valerianus @CaliphFaggoti Buildings are not as valuable as the men you lost, even if they were rats.'
@azzamalirhabi Looks like the Daeshbags are now completely broken and fleeing the Kobane area.
@NAInfidels @semzyxx @owais00 Nothing justifies the existence of any Muslim country.  All Muslim land is stolen land.'
@Dabiq_Warrior That whole "lions of Islam" thing is like some kind of red neck comedy.'
@buberzionist @MJayRosenberg Maybe you should encourage more Jewish girls to marry black men to show how you are open minded.'
@IsraeliRegime Then he launched a completely unprovoked attack on the Jews of Khybar, murdered many and stole their land.'
Muslims try to defend their prophet against pedophelia they never tell you about the proof that he was a pedo.
@Citywolf_IS3 @Censored31 Yes, but it smells great now that the Daesh rats have run.'
@NAInfidels @semzyxx @owais00 Hey, idiot! You can't use the problems of Judaism to justify the barbarity of the Quran."
@IsraeliRegime Then he attacked and defeated the third Medina tribe, beheaded all the men and enslaved women and children.'
@TheAtlantic This is political opinion.  The truth is that Islam is itself radical and we must outlaw it.'
Mohammed told women to cover up and stay home.  ISIS tells women to cover up and stay home.'
No, that is the excuse Mohammed used to rob and murder. He states his genocidal intention here.
@Totenleserin Countryside will be easy to take. Mosul and Raqqa will be difficult because the Daesh will hid behind civilians'
@NAInfidels @owais00 As you can see for yourself, pedophelia is illegal in Israel, but is legal in Muslim countries. Outlaw Islam!'
@sajid_fairooz @IsraeliRegime The Muslims are out of control and determined to steal the last tiny piece of land left to the Jews'
And without western invention, the Muslim oil resources would be nothing but a filthy, useless liquid.'
True. Stoning and beheading were much more to Mohammed's taste."

@IsraeliRegime The treatment of Christians was nearly as bad.  And people not of the book were murdered outright.'
Yes, we have heard it a million times.  Islam is not about Islam.'
A worshipper of the pedophile prophet has no room to call anyone a biggot, since Islam is a religion of hate and bigotry.'
@NAInfidels @owais00 But Muslims are dying to live under Sharia and to bring back all the vileness and barbarity of their prophet.'
Obama refuses to recognize that there is no difference between the behavior of the prophet Mohammed and ISIS.'

And traitors are individuals, not tribes and their women and children. You make up lying excuses for barbarity like a Muslim.'
Do you approve of your prophet raping children?'
And I'm not sure how you can yammer about homelessness when Muslims are still murdering people for apostacy and blasphemy."
@NAInfidels @owais00 I don't give a shit about what the Talmud says because  Jews all live under secular laws not under Talmud."
@KenRoth: Women from Pakistan's Christian and Hindu minorities are particularly vulnerable to forced marriage to Muslim men.
Your prophet was a low life murdering, raping, robbing, bigoted, sexist, pedophile.'
compared to the sewer and violence and poverty of Muslim Pakistan, Americans live in opulence.'
Colonizing and raping is how the Muslim world got to be the size it is.  The first crusades were Muslims invading Europe.'
@Totenleserin In other words, you were too stupid to understand that your 7th century barbarity would bring more enemies.'
What was Mohammed defending when he attacked the Jews of Khybar?'
@teenage Dodge rambles on making assertion after assertion with zero evidence and no references in Quran or Hadith. It's garbage"
Do you approve of your pedophile prophet raping a 9 year old girl, like it says in 7 hadith?'

@tweetybird2009 @PatVPeters Mohammed had people,who disagreed with him murdered. ISIS murders the same.'
@NAInfidels @owais00 And the Muslim students Hadith database shows Ashia was 6 when the pedo Mohammed married her.'
The story about her age came from both Aisha and Ursa. It can be found in both Bukhari and Muslim.'
@IsraeliRegime Yes they are Jew hating barbarians.'
Defensive sword? ROFLMAO. The Muslims defended themselves all the way to France and India.'
@tweetybird2009 @PatVPeters Mohammed was an imperialist that led 17 major military expeditions. ISIS is imperialist.'

@BreitbartNews This is what Christians and other non Muslims have had to deal with for 1400 years in the Middle East.'
Furthermore, all the Hadiths about Aisha's age are classified as Sahih - meaning Sound."

Religion is a factor.  ISIS kills Sunnis for disobedience.  They kill religious minorities just for being non Sunni Muslims.'
@IsraeliRegime And periodically the Muslims went on rampages and murdered masses of Jews. This happed all over Muslim world.'
Terrorism has been the core of Islam ever since the fraudulent prophet Mohammed invented it.'
More of the same kind of burning by other Muslims.  #Islam'

@teenage Let people read the Quran and see that it comes from hate.
The few things Islam came up with were from conquered people and came in spite of Islam, not because of it.'
@MaDaSaHaTtEr_17 You lie again. The Quran and Hadith do tell you to murder "non believers"
@MaDaSaHaTtEr_17 Mohammed was a slave trader who owned 28 slaves.'
And the Muslims robbed the wealthy merchants.'
@ToAllahWeReturn Need I say more? Destroy Islam before it destroys us.
@DblBlackDs Looks like you are the ignorant asshole, in that there is no other religion that has close to that number.'
Yes, he's vile because he is against a religion that has produced more than 100 terroris groups.
@MaDaSaHaTtEr_17 Mohammed later attacked the Jews of Khybar, slaughtered many and also stole their property.'
Wrong Jewish tribe microbrain.  The Jews of Khybar had nothing to do with Mohammed.'

You are a total liar, just like your pedophile prophet. UN soldiers don't burn people alive."
Mohammed owned 28 slaves. So if you are against slavery you are against Mohammed. Otherwise you are just bull shiting.'
But the western world gave up slavery on it's own. No one forced them from the outside."
Stupid comment. That was illegal for US soldiers and they were punnished.  For Muslims, their organizations make murderers heroes.'
@EVIL_DAESH: 12-yr-old sold as #ISIS slave to a 50-yr-old man said she didn't know what rape meant- only that she woke up bleeding

@watan71969 99% of the time you Muslims play the victim card it's a lie and the reverse is true.
@batchelorshow @FearDept I'm talking total extermination, bragged about right there in the book."
The hypocrisy of Islam is that they expect to convert people from other religions but they murder converts from their own.'
Because while other groups can evolve, the violence of the Quran and Hadith prevent Islam from ever being a human religion.'
@batchelorshow @FearDept Look, the heroes of the Torah exterminated every man, woman, child and animal in some cities.'
Islam is an entire religion built on intolerance and jihad. It's time for the world to stop tolerating it."
How many Muslims there are is irrelevant. The declaration of war on mankind is clearly spelled out in Quran and Hadiths.'
@munthir555 Let's stop pretending and get the war between the Islamolunatics and the rest of the world started now."
The Muslims also invaded India and murdered 80 million Hindus. They virtually exterminated all Buddhist on in India.'
Europe needs to expel their Muslim immigrants.'
@batchelorshow @FearDept So, if I say that you must be a murdering fascist because you follow that book, am I right?'
@watan71969 Those Jews are assholes.  Most Jews are secular and humanist.  Most Muslims are Islamists.

And now, every Jihadi group wants to reinstate slavery in the present because the Quran approves it and Mohammed practiced.'
@geeky_zekey Problem with vile Muslims is that they try to rationalize &amp; excuse the crimes of Islam rather than get rid of them.'
Actually, Muslims enslaved far more than anyone else. The prophet Mohammed was a slave trader. Jesus had no slaves.'
@mattybboi83 @Number10gov Islam is a hate mongering death cult that declared war on humanity. That fact should be talked about.'
@watan71969 Read the statistics microbrain. Look at the percentage of the worlds Muslims that want to kill apostates.'
@RavenHUWolf: The logic of Islam reflects clearly in those who follow its ideology and oaths to be muhammad's slave.
Furthermore, the Muslims were the last to give up slavery, and many only did it under pressure from the west.'
And since Islam declared war on all humanity. Humanity must return the favor and declare war on Islam.'
Islam is a slave religion, both for it's followers and for the people it enslaves, and for the dhimmis it rules."
@JRehling Every religion and non religion on the planet is at war with Islam. Every border with a Muslim state is a bloody border'
No minorities of any kind are left in Saudi and several other gulf states, having been exterminated by Muslims.'
@mattybboi83 @Number10gov Not masked. The Quran and the Hadith declared war on humanity 1400 years ago.
The Muslims conquered 2/3 of the Christian world before it attacked back. So again, what are you crying about.'
@The_Beamster @Sheikh_Times4 So let's get it over with. The world needs to declare war on Islam and get rid of the cancer."
What are you talking about provocation? Islam declared war with the world.  That is more than enough provocation.'
The Muslims attacked and murdered the Zoastrians in Persia and the Buddhists in Afghanistan.'
@watan71969 You dumb asshole, he legalized slavery, he raped slave girls, he was a pedophile. How can you call him great anything.'
Killing people because they believe differently than you and express that is not an excuse for murder except among Muslims.'
Wrong. Apostacy is the equivalent of leaving America and becoming a citizen of another country. There is no penalty.'
But your whole conversation about slavery is phony bull shit propaganda since you follow a slave owner prophet.'
Islam has Hadiths that tell you what hand to use to wipe your ass. There is zero room for individualism in it.'
I have no fear of idiots like you at all.What turns my stomach is the destruction to freedom and humanity that Islam causes'
@RavenHUWolf: Islam's War On Women Continues. Islam continues to show how they value women...\n
Oh please. Lecture me about porn when Muslims are the worlds biggest porn consumers and Islamic heaven is a brothel.'
@RavenHUWolf: Arab slave trade: 140 to 200 million non-Muslim slaves from all colors and nationalities - still happening today!\n
Yeah, I know. Being a human being is against Islam. Islam must be outlawed.'
Islam is the most genocidal religion on the planet.  Mankind must exterminate Islam or be exterminated by it.'
Good. We have established that Muslims are slavers and that their humanity has failed to evolve past slave owning.'
@mattybboi83 @Number10gov But Islam keeps trying to return to the 7th century.'
@mattybboi83 @Number10gov Because Christianity is dying out and the Christian world has reformed itself.'
@munthir555 ROFLMAO.  Where is the picture Daeshbag?'
@JRehling The world is doing nothing. Islam is producing the terrorist activities and has been for 1400 years.'
Islam declared war on all mankind 1400 years ago. Now we return the favor.
@mattybboi83 @Number10gov If you don't think that Muslims invaded Christianity and Europe first you are to historically ignorant"
@s_rsantorini630 @pari_passu Islam was made for stupid, violent, lying, criminal, useless thugs and you fill the bill exactly.'
How long before some idiot politician tells us that this is not about Islam, but about some Islamic extremist? #Copenhagen'
@mattybboi83 @Number10gov Muslims invaded and conquered 2/3 of Christianity before Christians responded. So stick your lies.'
And if Muslims are angry that they can't force Islam on people, who cares?
@geeky_zekey And looking at your page, I can see that you are in the business of photoshopping images, Islamist cocksucker.'
It's Muslims that do virtually all the killing.  For example, 80% of civilians killed in Afghanistan are killed by Taliban."
I wouldn't be too concerned about that, because outside the canon of Islam, there is no historical evidence of Mohammed."
@watan71969 The asshole prophet Mohammed who was a slave trader, pedophile, murderer, war monger, sexist, bigot, caravan robber.'
I'm totally sick of these politically expedient statements after every attack by Islam on humanity."
@mattybboi83 @Number10gov What matters is that people like you are trying to lay a guilt trip on us while ignoring the truth.'
@mattybboi83 @Number10gov Again you are the liar. Muslims invaded Europe 400 years before the crusades.'
Yes, the western world was unaware of the layer of Islamolunatics that lived under the thumbs of the dictators.'
@mattybboi83 @Number10gov There are over 100 Islamic terrorist organizations. KKK Virtually dead. There is no canceling out.'
The lesson the world learned about Islam is that when we get rid of their brutal dictators, they are replaced by brutal Islamists'
Why would I care about the opinion of a guy who follows a pedophile prophet?'
This is why the world knows that Muslims are Taqiyya liars that manufacture fraudulent data.'
@edgeofthesandbx @FearDept Ask the Muslims.  They are the ones killing all the Jews.'
May Allah bless him with 72 virgin pigs.'
And 83:25 says they drink wine in heaven. So Islamic heaven is basically a drunken whore house. Very spiritual - lol.'
It's not a prophet competition. It's about following a fraud who owned slaves, had people murdered, was a bigot, etc."
That's how Muslims react when the traffic light turns red."
@mattybboi83 @Number10gov Child abuse is illegal in western culture. It is accepted in Islamic cultures because their prophet...'
@s_rsantorini630 @pari_passu The Muslims think that lying is the greatest of all virtues, after genocide.'
@dandiedinmont @Number10gov Yeah, break relations with the only ME democracy that the Muslims are trying to exterminate. Smart.'
@JRehling The difference is that Islam has a requirement for Jihad, has over 100 large terrorist orgs., and declared war on world'
And furthermore, they murder anyone who tries to convert a Muslim, but demand the freedom to convert non Muslims.'
It's not about a single terrorist. There are an endless supply of them. It's about a hate cult called Islam."
@watan71969 These morons that you show talking about Mohammed give no facts and knew nothing about him.'
ISIS continues their big successes against unarmed civilians. They just can't win a fight against anything but families."
And some idiots want to support the Muslims that are trying to exterminate Israel.'
Good tweet. But they actually start selling their daughters at 9.'
By practicing Islam you are vomiting on all Jews, Christians and non believers. Check code of Umar.
@watan71969 Furthermore, your heroes the Taliban are responsible for the murder of 80% of Afghan civilians. So stick it asshole.'
The fact that there were two layers of evil to be dealt with in Iraq doesn't mean they should both be left alone."
The Muslims are the crusaders, microbrain.'
The point is about what the society supports and what it does not support. Barbarity is not an aberration in Muslim society.'
The drivel is correct. ISIS behaves exactly as the prophet Mohammed behaved.'

@Quickieleaks Yeah, I read that. And every verse of the Tao Te Ching is superior to every verse of the Quran. So Quran is fraud.'
@bbcturkce The Sunni Turkmen are genocidal criminals living off loot they stole from minorities. What they want counts for nothing'

So if a Buddhist owns a slave you can say that he goes against his religion.  But a Muslim slave owner is not going against his.'

There is no difference in what the prophet Mohammed did and in what ISIS does.'
@syedmuhammad555 Sure. Why do one third of Muslims want to murder people who want to leave Islam?
do ISIS, the Saudis and the Taliban imprison women in their homes? Because the Quran tells them to.  #Islam #Iraq
Saudi would be a big joke if it wasn't crushing the lives of millions of people. #Islam"
A religion who has a murdering, hating pedophile at it's core has no room to be reformed."
do Saudis, Pakistanis, ISIS and Taliban brutalize their women? Because Islam tells them to.
Because more slavery exists in the Islamic world than anywhere else.  And I am very much against N. Korea.'

@KellyTurner99 The Muslim citizens of Raqqa enjoying a peaceful day of beating three men to death.
Fuck Allah, the phony god of Islam and terrorism.  Outlaw #Islam now.'
Saying that #Islam is a way of life means that human freedom is forbidden and the inhuman laws of a criminal must be followed.'
This is actually the only kind of job that mujahedeen are intellectually suited for.'
If you don't follow what is in the Sunnah you don't follow what is in the Sunnah.  I could care less about your indignation."

Who cares. ISIS does what Mohammed did. Tens of thousands also do and have joined him. Muslims crazy.
@FaheemHus @jackmjenkins The example of Mohammed gives us a man who owned slaves, raped women, beheaded 600 Jews in one day.'
@FaheemHus @jackmjenkins All this means is that Muslims endlessly try to hide the barbarity of their religion.'
@buellerishere Those law abiding Muslims that have a 90% domestic violence rate in Pakistan and murder people for blasphemy.'
Mostly it shows how vile, inhuman, digusting, and barbaric that religion is. #Islam'
@InviteToIslam And madrassa rats are always stupid, like the one who just claimed that the sun goes around the earth.'
@FaheemHus @jackmjenkins The Atlantic got it exactly right, and every point in thinkprogress is easily refuted.'
I just told you that women owned property before Islam. Had nothing to do with Islam. Islam is sexist to the very core.'
@abualiis I hope they just outlaw the vile religion of Islam entirely. They should have done it 30 years ago.'
@KellyTurner99 And the Hadiths are even more specific about approving sexual slavery.'
The prophet Mohammed didn't bother to help the poor to convert them, but rather converted at the point of the sword."

@KellyTurner99 And they all use the same barbaric Quran and Hadiths and they all abuse women.'
@KellyTurner99 "That which your right hand posses" means slave.  The Quran gives clear permission to rape slaves.'

@buellerishere @isra_jourisra @fei989 They are always hot air. But sometimes their hot air aligns with their prophets.'
Had nothing to do with Islam. Mohammed's first wife was a rich merchant before Islam."
Saying that Islam is a way of life means that it tells you that you cannot have democracy and must instead follow a pedophile.'
@davidjones720: OBAMA and his love for golf is greater that love for CHRISTIANS or Jews !
@FaheemHus @jackmjenkins For example, the literary style of the Quran is always very literal. Little use of metaphors, etc.'

@nrllhkose Fuck these people that want to steal our freedom of speech for the sake of a fascist religious ideology.'
@ExposeFalsehood Muslims don't produce Thomas Jeffersons or Mahatma Ghandis. And they don't produce freedom or democracy."
Islam treats women like slaves and anyone who says otherwise is stabbing women in the back.
@KellyTurner99 Since the Islamist Erdogan came to power,women's employment in Turkey fell 30%.He considers them baby machines"
@ExposeFalsehood But the pedophile prophet Mohammed only cared about his pecker and his perverted desires.'
You just proved that you are stupid.  I just showed you the Hadiths where Mohammed calls women stupid and you still deny it.'
@FaheemHus @jackmjenkins The peaceful Q verses are pre Medina, Mecca verses when Mohammed had little power and was endangered.'
@buellerishere We are wasting our time with Kelly. She is willing to stab 800 million women in the back just to be PC.'

Then why do you smelly rag heads keep moving to Britian?'
@Marwan_Tunsi_ @alwallawalbara My suggestion would be that the Kuffar bomb the Kabba.'
Of course The old leach Mohammed gave himself permission to screw pretty much whatever he liked.
Buddha forbid slavery 1100 years before Mohammed. Jesus had no slaves 600 years before Mohammed. But Mohammed was forced to have?'
@Arab_News Forcing others to accept the barbarity of Islam is actual obligation.
In 1400 years Islam has never produced anything other than tyrants, and the world is obligated to deal with them.'
The Saudis were the Mujahedeen before there was any involvement of the US.'
Furthermore, those Jews were not nomads.  In fact, the city of Medina was established by Jews before Mohammed attacked them.'
@ExposeFalsehood .....80% of Afghan civilians are killed by Taliban. So it is a service to mankind to bomb the Taliban.'
@tummala82 @IndyVoices There is no choice. Ban Islam or it will destroy humanity.'
The Islam is the hate, microbrain.
If Muslims ever produced a decent leader the world would be overjoyed to accept him.'
I know that they teach their kids to hate Jews but they teach them nothing that is needed to run a country or economy.'
@tummala82 @IndyVoices There is no reason at all why a hate cult cannot be banned.'
Muslims train babies to hate and murder, then use them for propaganda.
You really are a raving Islamolunatic. Our soldiers are never, ever allowed to rape anyone. If they do they have broken the law.'
As usual, you are a Muslim liar making any excuses for a religion of barbarity, murder, hatred, and sexism. And now you are blocked.'
I know that they force the same sexism, hatred and bigotry on their population that all Islamolunatics do.'
@CENTCOM The Daesh rats keep announcing victories at the same time they keep loosing men and land.  The world is laughing at them.'
@rogue_allah Futhermore, Islam is based on theft. Mohammed raised his armies by giving them 4/5 of everything they stole.'
@jessicaelgot There is no such thing as Islamophobia, just as there is no such thing as Naziphobia.'
Seems like being a Muslim and living off a steady diet of conspiracy theories go together.  Islam is a religion of ignorance.'
He is lying. It's Islam. ISIS does nothing that the prophet Mohammed did not also do."
The Sahara and the Arabian peninsula are different places, microbrain.'
@CherguiaMbark Taqiyya is used by all Muslims. Mohammed was a liar who often lied for Islam.'
I know that they are dedicated to the extermination of the Jews just like their prophet Mohammed was.'
The fact that I have a brain prevents me from accepting Islam.'
@ExposeFalsehood And it is Muslims who were the first crusaders, attacking the Christian world for centuries before it attacked back'
@MaxBlumenthal Fuck you. Every Palestinian school teaches children to hate Jews and Kuffir.'
@CherguiaMbark Because Islamic canon are a pack of contradictory idiocy. In other Hadiths Mohammed says to kill all dogs.'
@femfreq Who cares? The only issue is are they guilt or innocent.  All the rest is race baiting by assholes like you.'
By showing your love of a genocidal animal like Baghdadi you have given the reason why Islam must be exterminated.'
@uygaraktas That's because Gaza is full of Jihadi criminals who have never done a days work in their lives."
That's because it's all about the barbarity of Islam, not the beards."
Another cheap Muslim lie. Give me proof of any Muslim that was punished for not being kind to the slave girls they raped.'
But it really doesn't matter who the Mujahedeen animals are fighting. They have been murdering someone for 1400 years."
I know that Muslim bigotry has driven all the Christians out of Palestine.'
@HeidiL_RN: To allow Muslims to pervert our US constitutional rights via domestic mosques and Islam teaching is outrageous. #BanIslam #c'
@uygaraktas Considering the endless stream of murders against minorities by Muslims, who cares.'
@RaviAgrawalCNN Another case of, "If you say Islam is violent we will kill you."'
Not only do that, but they can dump their wives, leaving them nothing, by saying three times, "I Divorce you". Barbaric.'
@WarHorse2014 As long as it's not an Islamolunatic in power that forces Sharia on people who don't want it, who cares."
Islamophobia - Fear of this.
@FAIRmediawatch The apharthide is a Muslim thing. They have exterminated Jews and Christians in most of ME.'
@asoodalrafidain Maybe the media didn't have space after reporting the about the thousands murdered by Muslims that week."
@alwallawalbara The intellect of a Muslim cretin who thinks Allah made all mankind so one part could make war on another.'
@MaxBlumenthal And the Quran says that the Muslims must steal and occupy the entire world.'
@rogue_allah You are lying again, just like a Muslim. The Quran approves of raping slave girls explicitly.'
I know that the terrorist organization Hamas has not had another election since their first one.'
@RamiAlLolah Considering what those "local Arabs" did to Kurds, Christians, Assyrians, Ezidiz, etc., who cares.'
@rogue_allah The reason why Mohammed's thugs went to war was to get what they could steal."
1400 years ago Islam stole all women's rights and turned them into slaves forever."
@CherguiaMbark The Hadiths are the Sunnah of the Prophet, microbrain. So you can't throw out the ones you don't like."
One of the vile things about Islam is that it murders people for exercising their freedom of speech.'
Islamophobia is like Naziphobia, it's an abuse of language for political gain. It looks like this.
You are the one who believes in a god that asks one part of his creation to murder another part. Impossible to get any stupider.'
@iAmCaticorn People who hate the Nazis are not extremists. And there is no diff between Islam and Nazis.'
Islamophobia - fear of this.
No, the money comes from Muslims around the world who want a caliphate and the domination of Islam by force.'
@ummahwitness And no doubt your friend was every place where ISIS could have been murdering children.'
So which ones are the "moderate" Muslims?  #Islam'
Islamophobia - fear of this.
I know that the Palestinians are a group of murdering terrorists that provide no human rights to their population.'
But in Islam they can rape captive women to their hearts content and there is no law against it.'
@femfreq Female engineers make 1.17 comp to male engineers. So without specific professional comparisons your info is useless.'
Again, you are a Muslim liar. Mohammed said nothing about "stray". And most civilized countries try to find strays homes.'
Fighting along side anyone in the ME makes you someone else's enemy, regardless of the motivation. Their problem, not ours."
I know that they have the same policy of breeding like rats and population imperialism as their prophet Mohammed.'
LOL. First you deny that Islam permits the rape of slave girls, then you verify it. Get lost. I'm tired of you."
Balance what? The hate cult of Islam has zero place in American schools.'
@EuklidProof @Kobane_YPG As a certified inmate of the Islamasylum, you don't have the ability to judge."
@RavenHUWolf: Read it Liberals &amp; get a reality check on life! Within Islam your views, beliefs, any democracy system, mean nothing!
Perish slowly my ass. Slavery lasted longer in the Muslim world that anywhere else. And your hero is trying to bring it back.'
These campaigns are all lies that try to portray Islam to the West as being the exact opposite of what it really is - barbaric.'
@iyad_elbaghdadi Good. Anything is better than having Islamofascists in power.'
@uygaraktas There is no such thing as Islamophobia.  That is like saying there is Naziphobia.'
@Nebula1979 I'm not interested in your sectarian divisions. Shia and Sunni are all following the vile pedophile prophet."
#Islam is so against idols that they smash Assyrian and Buddhists statues, then why do they pray at Mecca and circumambulate the Kabba?'
@nobigotry: Islam is in the news EVERYDAY. \nNot for good works but for it's Savage Evil !
He's lying. There is nothing that ISIS does that the prophet Mohammed did not also do."
Islam declared war on all humanity 1400 years ago. While individual Muslims may or may not be terrorist,Islam is terrorist.'
@Pastle_souls They are not as stupid as you, since Islam is not a race.'
@CarolineFourest No matter how desperately race baiting trash like you want Islam to be a race, it's not."
In the meantime the terrorists who want to destroy Israel have murdered hundreds of thousands and scum like you excuse them.'
@arrowsmithwoman: @sudixitca @KenRoth  It's a calculated Arab policy, to keep the Palestinians in a state of desperation to incite more "
Islamophobia - fear of this.
Islamophobia - fear of this.
Islam doesn't answer anything.  It pretends to answer with illogical and delusional superstition."
The Islamic communities have proven themselves to be violent lunatics.
I don't care if they are Shia Islamolunatics or Sunni Islamolunatics. The are all filth to me."
@iShewaani Factual evidence? There were never more than 5 million Native American Indians on the North American continent.'
Islamophobia - fear of this.
@ExposeFalsehood And there is the next thing that is wrong with Muslims, most of you are liars. 80% were killed by Taliban.'
The Muslim pedophiles do this all the time. It's so common and accepted that it's not even news."

Filthy Taquiyya liar. The abuse of women by #Islam couldn't be clearer.

Yeap, there is only so much bandwidths for self genocidal Jews, and it's Blumenthal's turn to be the center of attention."

@logicalmind11 Quran 8.12 would be a good example of terrorism.
@MaxBlumenthal So how much freedom of speech is there in Gaza? And do you Jew hating bigots write about that?'
It is justice to punish your parents if they taught you murder like Islam teaches murder.

Wrong. Islam didn't give women any rights and it imprisoned them in their houses. Remember Katjia was wealthy BEFORE Islam."
@MaxBlumenthal @NickKristof Every border that Islam has with every other religion and non religion is bloody.'

@Alfonso_AraujoG @MaxBlumenthal @oldkhayyam Yeah, being anti Zionist is pretending to have an excuse for being anti Semitic.'
@AmyMek: #IslamLOVESWomen Muslim files suit AGAINST law banning child marriage,"OFFENDS Islam"  #IWD2015
He only meant knowledge of his fraudulent religion. Mohammed was an illiterate who didn't know squat."
270 million people were killed by Islamolunatics shouting Allahu Akbar.
@Rudd1971 Since 90% of Muslim civilians are killed by Muslim terrorists, you Avatar is just propaganda.'
This is lying propaganda. If you want to know what filth and hatred Islam is, just read the Quran.'
And ISIS does what Islam requires. 33:33 is just the start.'

@fai3an_H The very definition of Islam is hatred and negativity. We have to get rid of that cancer so civilization can advance.'
do Muslims force women to cover up and stay at home?  The Quran tells them to. #Islam
The content of the Quran and Hadiths give Islam a bad name.'
@PeterTownsend7: #ISIS #Muslim You're a woman and you're committed to #Islam? You cannot be serious!
Here are Churchill's views about the pedophile prophet.
People were making scientific discoveries, including Algebra, before Islam.'
@greenlinerzjm Mohammed had people murdered who disagreed with him. He raped women. He married a 6 year old. He beheaded Jews.'
Islamophobia is like Naziphobia. There is no such thing.'
@urgedharry @greenlinerzjm Your religion is a murderous pile of filth.
@biebervalue @greenlinerzjm What your prophet said was that women are stupid and corrupt. #Islam
@greenlinerzjm Here is the Quran stating that the witness of a woman is worth half that of a man. #Islam
@stevoiraq I don't trust ISIS or the Shia militia. Both want to force their sick religion on people. #Tikrit"
@versacezaynx @nyazpolitics Most of the African slaves were slaves of Muslims.'
This is propaganda. The Shia militia are religious fanatics and fascists just like ISIS - only slightly less extreme.'
Look at the kinds of opinions that the Islamic world is stuck with.
@greenlinerzjm You fucking moron, slavery is approved right in the Quran. Read it you stupid idiot.'
@zene55 @bq281473 @foxnewspolitics @BarackObama    There is no difference between what ISIS does and what Mohammed did.'
Islam is hatred and Jihad.
@fai3an_H The problem is that I have far more knowledge of Islam than you and it is your mind that has been shrunken by Islam.'
And I know that Umar imposed the code of Umar, making Jews and Christians third class citizens for centuries.'
Mohammed raped slave girls, the Quran approves of the rape of slave girls - so ISIS rapes, slave girls.'
Every Muslim convert becomes Muslim propaganda.'
The Islamic world was still in the dark ages before the French showed up.'
@lajouetreine: RT@UnPoliticalPrty: The true history of #Islam and Slavery \n\nMUST SEE
Did he embrace Buddhism or Christianity or Hinduism and become a terrorist? No, it's always Islam that leads to terrorism."
@greenlinerzjm Here is the Quran telling men they can beat their wives and that men are superior.
Islam only served to slow down science. The few discoveries by Muslims were despite Islam, not because of Islam.'
But all the crimes of Islam are exactly according to their beliefs.'
The poor women do it because they marry a Muslim man and are pressured into it. Men do it in prison. It's a criminal's relig"
@ardiem1m @MaxBlumenthal Yes, I hate Nazis too. Got a problem with that?'
ISIS follows the Quran and Hadiths exactly. They follow the Sunnah exactly. The evil is in the Quran and Hadiths.'
The Quran approves of the beating of women and tells them to stay home. So ISIS does it also.
And it is Islam's preoccupation with violent victory rather than persuasion that makes it globally hated."
@SABCNewsOnline Why not? The Palestinians behead gays and honor kill women.'
@Rudd1971 True. But Islam is corrupt from the beginning.'
The Muslims killed millions when they entered Europe and India. But the question is, can we get beyond barbaric religion.'
The Shia militia are terrorists that are only slightly better than ISIS. Look at the Shia militia in Yemen.'
A. It's not the fastest growing religion. It's the fastest breeding religion."
You should be attacking everyone that follows a religious cult of hated and murder like Islam.'
An Islamist human rights group? LOL. Now there is a contradiction in terms.'
No it doesn't. Islam is grossly sexist. It is a misery for women.
Iran where there is no human freedom and where they murder Kurds, gays, apostates, political opponents.'
Okay, so we understand that the Quran makes striking a woman an option and that the woman must obey the man.'
Islam declared war on all humanity 1400 years ago and denying it is simply a lie.'
Good morning.  Here is the history of Islamic slavery.
@ardiem1m @MaxBlumenthal I hate Islam because it is a religion based on hatred and Jihad.
I'm not concerned with single events. I'm concerned with 1400 years of Islamic murder and barbarity that shows no sign of ending."
@fai3an_H At least I don't follow pedophile prophets or believe in mythical creatures of fire called Jinn."
But Islam is proud of their slavery, imperialism, and genocide against minorities. The are murdering Kurds in Iran now.'
Yeap, this is a big problem. The Shia militia is only slightly less fanatical and Islamofascist than the Daesh they are replacing.'
It means "God is Great". Often shouted while Muslims are murdering one of gods creations.'
Islam teaches exactly what ISIS practices.'
Two verses and we can agree that Islam tells women to stay home, cover up, obey your husband, right?'
Mohammed was a slave trader, caravan robber, murderer, beheader, rapist, sexist, bigot, liar and pedophile. Just like ISIS.'
@fanarhaddad Saudis regard ISIS as a threat. It's who is defeating them that they have a problem with."
Mohammed's first wife Katjia was a wealthy woman BEFORE Islam. So you are lying."
And since Islam is a religion of murder, bigotry and hatred, hating Islam is rational.
A phobia is an irrational hatred. There is no such thing as a  phobia for a hatred that is rational.'
@biebervalue @greenlinerzjm @halalflaws Mohammed raped Aishia when she was 9.
@kzaal Yes, let's try to fool people into believing a lie - that #Islam is a religion of peace."
@HuffPostRelig Denouncing terrorism and violence means denouncing the heart of Islam.
My 2:282 says that you can replace the testimony of one man with that of two women.'
Mohammed was suppose to be guided by god, and his example was for all mankind for all time. He was not suppose to follow.'
@haroonstyles @AMohedin @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Islam allows men divorce by saying I divorce you, three times, not women.'
@greenlinerzjm Actual Muslims know very little about Islam.'
Fuck the Quran.
Okay. So we agree that the Taliban and ISIS and Saudis are implementing 33:33.'
Both Daesh and Shia Militia are driven by a religion of hatred and bigotry and there will be no freedom in Tikrit, regardless.'
@BlissTabitha: Australia: Gifted teen embraces Islam, becomes a jihad terrorist
r translations of t Quranic verse that gives men the right to beat their wives and declares men superior.  #Islam'
Being able to practice their religion doesn't mean that they were not treated as third class citizens."
@greenlinerzjm Liar! Katjia was a business woman before there was Islam. Mohammed worked for her and had no choice about it.'
ISIS beheads people. Saudi beheads people. Mohammed beheaded 600 Jews.'
@Kaya786 Talk to me about being dumb when you figure out how to get working toilets into the Pakistani public schools.'
@nyazpolitics @greenlinerzjm Laugh all you want. Islam is a steaming pile of shit. Good night. Blocked.'
But Islam has no truth. Every word is a lie.'
But the Christian and Jewish world had an enlightenment because they got past religion. Islamic world has never got past religion'
Fuck #Islam. Mohammed was a pedophile, murderer, bigot, sexist, rapist, slave trader, caravan robber, and liar.'
@urgedharry @greenlinerzjm I have three translations of the Quran, microbrain. And I know far more about Islam than you.'
@greenlinerzjm @halalflaws @biebervalue You try again. Mohammed screwed Aisha when she was 9.
B. The only reason there are non Muslims on the earth is because the non Muslim armies defeated the Muslims.'
Mohammed was a slave owner and the Quran allows slavery. So ISIS returns to slavery.
@greenlinerzjm Horseshit. Mohammed led 17 major military expeditions, owned 28 slaves, had 9 wives - one six years old.'
@biebervalue @greenlinerzjm The women convert to Islam because they marry Muslim men. Men convert in prison.'
And by the way, the entire world hates Islam.'
@biebervalue @greenlinerzjm Your prophet never said that. And countries like Pakistan have a 90% domestic violence rate.'
@halalflaws @greenlinerzjm @biebervalue 80% of Muslim civilians are killed by Taliban. Look it up.'
@nyazpolitics @greenlinerzjm If you actually knew about Islam you would know how violent and barbaric
@greenlinerzjm Here is the Quran telling Muslim men that they can rape their slave girls.
What is the difference between what ISIS does and what the prophet Mohammed did, microbrain? #Islam'

No, shithead, they were killed or forced to convert. Mohammed started the ball rolling by beheading 600 Jewish prisoners.'
@MaxBlumenthal @Campagnebds Because there are no Zionist thugs. Just people protecting themselves from Muslim head choppers'
The Prophet Mohammed beheaded 600 Jews for not being loyal to him. And all the Muslims love Mohammed. So what's the problem?"
No the Muslims murdered the Jews the traditional Muslim way, with swords, knives, and spears. And they did it for 1400 years.'
@MaxBlumenthal @rudoren @nytimes Your proph beheaded 600 Jewish men &amp; sold the women and children into slavery. And you love him.'
Try sending the Bible to some Muslim lunatics.  Saudi won't even allow it in the country. More religious freedom in Israel."
@RaniaKhalek There was no Shujaiya massacre. The place was full of Blumenthal's terrorist friends and their weapons."

Virtually all the women being beaten and tortured in the world are getting it from Muslims.

@stevesalaita Look at this ranting lunatic Palestinian. Interesting what he tells us.
@MaxBlumenthal It is an obvious fact that most Jews lived in ghettoes under the bigoted Muslims.'
ROFL. Jews used to live on 40% of Arabian peninsula. Who is committing genocide against who?'
@MaxBlumenthal The difference is that he only said it. The Muslims are doing it.'
@georgegalloway But why propagandize your bigotry when Pakistani Muslims are murdering Christians and Hindus for blasphemy?'

@TRobinsonNewEra:  England and Wales child rape cases up 37% in five years\nWe all know why'
Most likely killed by Muslims; and I'm happy to see the Israelis get back a small fraction of the land the Muslims stole."
@AlterNet @MaxBlumenthal Most countries are moving in that direction. But not Muslim ones.
@Naazzk What about the environmental racism experience by Christians, Jews, Ezidis, Hindus, etc. in Muslim countries?'
Muslims want to be able to abuse other while at the same time pretending to be victims.'
In fact, Mohammed and his thugs were starving before they captured Khybar, stole the Jews property, and made them pay to live'
@Tobin_Maker @MaxBlumenthal  No, the murdering Hamaz head choppers torture children in dungeons.'
Only an idiot that doesn't history would say that.You have never studied the barbarity of the Muslims during that entire time"
The reason that there are still Muslims and not Jews and Christians is due to Muslim brutality.'
Free them to do what? Cut off the heads of gays? Honor killings? Child marriage? Exterminate Jews? Throw ppl off buildings?'
@RaniaKhalek @norabf Here is a Hamas: Palestinians are Saudis and Egyptians conducting religious war.
@AlterNet @MaxBlumenthal Mohammed owned slaves, Jesus did not.  Mohammed robbed caravans. Jesus did not.'
blacks have shot two police officers and a 5 year old in #Ferguson.'
And I don't care if the Jews do what the have to do to protect themselves from the genocidal Muslims."
Because the Muslims have been exterminating Jews for 1400 years. And Mohammed started he Muslim hatred of Jews.'
Like the Ottoman Empire was a pure slave state.'
The crimes of Islam far outdistance any imagined crimes of Israel.'
And we would all be worshiping the god of terrorism.'
There isn't even a remote comparison between Abu Grahib and those images. And what happens in those images represents Islam."
Another line of horseshit. The poor Muslims being attacked. But virtually all their attacks were offensive.'
No, the Muslims worldwide are the problem. Israel is protecting itself against the same Muslim persecution that is global.'
Again you are an idiot. The Muslims were thugs. They quickly figured out that if they forced everyone to convert there..'
And the lying Muslims claimed that all of their attacks were only done because they were preemptive.'
51 Christians or Hindus have been murdered for blasphemy by Muslim mobs in Pakistan alone. Why should Israel be subject to that?'
Mohammed led 17 major military expedition and murdered &amp; raped and enslaved tens of thousands.Jesus,Buddha, Lao Tse lead none'
@AlterNet @MaxBlumenthal In every Christian nation you can say what you want about Christians &amp; Jesus. Muslims kill for blasphemy.'
All of Islam is blinded by hatred. The religion was built on hatred and intimidation.
Somewhere in the world Muslims are at war with Jews, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, Taoists, Atheists, and anamists.'
@AlterNet @MaxBlumenthal The majority have radical and violent opinions when they are polled about them.
And if you are going to follow a prophet that approved of collateral damage, then don't complain about collateral damage."
Here are the verses from Quran and Hadith proving genocidal aim of the Muslim biggots.
No, idiot, Zionism is the determination of Jews to recover a small fraction of the land stolen from them by Muslims.'
In fact, all the things that ISIS does are the things that the prophet Mohammed did in the past.'
@AlterNet @MaxBlumenthal Mohammed led 17 major military expeditions that killed tens of thousands. Jesus led none.'
@MaxBlumenthal Another taqiyya liar making up garbage for the sake of  Mohammed's desire to exterminate Jews."
@PTISalarKhan @georgegalloway Israel has to fight not to become a victim of people like this.  #Islam'
No, it's obvious that who is the target of the weapon that is the issue. Killing terrorists with any kind of weapon is good."
@PTISalarKhan @georgegalloway But the population in Palestine is still blowing up. No, Muslim abuse is the worst.'
I call that one thousands of the number of people Muslims murder every day.'
True. And the outcome has to be bad when either group of Islamolunatics wins.'
@PTISalarKhan @georgegalloway The Israelis are fighting not to become the minority victims that all other minorities are.'
@RavenHUWolf: Bloodthirsty Muslims flock to ISIS' theatre that loop jihadi atrocities they enjoy watching.\n
And the Muslims want to destroy Israel because they are racists, not because of the land, which is tiny.
Another race baiting idiot. If it were about "brown men" I would hate Hinduism and Buddhism and Tao. But I only hate Islam.'
I have three Qurans. And the only few peaceful verses were later abrogated by dozens of violent verses.'
It's not just a few Muslims, it's more than half.
@RavenHUWolf: Many of the ISIS members are walking "stoners" ~ even #daesh #Emwazi #JihadiJohn it\'s been rumored he\'s high on #Khat
@MaxBlumenthal @veganforareason @dhere Christians and Hindus murdered for blasphemy by Muslim mobs.
@biebervalue @greenlinerzjm Already proven that Islam abuses women &amp; I showed statistics to back it up. I'm bored with repetition."
@AlterNet @MaxBlumenthal Mohammed raped women. Jesus did not. Mohammed had people murdered. Jesus did not.'
@MuftahOrg Lol. You think there are no probs for people who don't tow the main stream line in Muslim c.
The Jews were murdered for 1400 years by rampaging Muslim mobs in Spain, N. Africa, and the ME.'
The Quran spells out global domination of humanity through jihad. The Torah has no such global aim.'
Who cares who defined it. The Muslims lived off the production of the Jews and left them impoverished.'
No asshole, I single out Muslims because their barbarity is set in stone in the Quran and they have not and cannot evolve.'
But Islamolunatic live by Islam and Sharia trying to fulfill Mohammed's wish to exterminate all Jews from peninsula."
Today, Christians are still murdered by rampaging Muslim mobs in Pakistan and Egypt.'
And you can only get highly educated people out of a free modern society, not a 7th century one based on superstition.'
